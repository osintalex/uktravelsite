Such activities may include attempts to disrupt traffic, protests in villages and near economic centres, burning tyres, throwing Molotov cocktails, and the use of improvised explosive devices. As a result there are occasional clashes between government security forces and protesters. Anniversary dates of significant events in Bahrain sometimes experience a number of unauthorised protests, which can start with little warning. Locations where such incidents have taken place in the past include Sitra, Bani Jamra, Karbabad, Saar, Karzakan, the Budaiya Highway and surrounding villages.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>While there have been no direct threats or attacks on British nationals to date, you should remain vigilant and be aware of your surroundings wherever you are on the island.</p>\n\n<p>Violent protests pose a risk to those who might inadvertently find themselves near to an active demonstration.</p>\n\n<p>If you encounter a large public gathering or demonstration, leave the area immediately.
