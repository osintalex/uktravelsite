You should use your own judgement to move towards a departure point only if and when you judge it is safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The British government\u2019s ability to facilitate onward travel from countries in the region is limited and you\u2019ll be expected to cover the cost of visas, accommodation, insurance and onward travel yourself. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Authorities across Yemen have introduced curfews and movement restrictions in order to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Implementation may vary and restrictions can change at short notice. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/yemen/coronavirus\">Coronavirus</a></p>\n\n<p>If you intend to travel within Yemen, you should regularly reassess your security arrangements and carefully plan your movements. Avoid routine, vary your travel routes, and keep a low profile at all times. You should take health and security advice from the host government, local authorities and/or competent security experts before any travel within the country. You should check your routes in advance of travelling. Don\u2019t advertise your travel or other plans through social media.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Yemen using an International Driving Permit. Access routes in and out of major cities may be closed or blocked. Check that the road is open before starting your journey. Driving standards are poor and mountain roads hazardous. There is a severe shortage of fuel in Yemen. You should avoid all road travel outside the main cities at night. Take care, there are minefields left over from civil wars and landmines used in the current conflict. Travelling off well-used tracks without an experienced guide could be extremely dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Yemeni air space is currently controlled by Saudi-led coalition forces. The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen have declared that starting from 15 August 2016, Sana\u2019a International Airport will be opened for United Nations and other international humanitarian organisations\u2019 flights. Humanitarian organisations must send a notice to the coalition in advance of each flight, and permission will be issued based on the status of military operations.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s an ongoing threat against foreigners and you are strongly advised to avoid places frequented by foreign nationals and to avoid travelling in an insecure and visible way.</p>\n\n<p>Given the current political, security and health situation, there\u2019s limited government control over parts of the country with Houthi or Al-Qaeda dominance in some areas.</p>\n\n<p>The political situation is uncertain and the threat of a further escalation of violence and disorder remains.</p>\n\n<p>The instability throughout Yemen has led to those in the south who support secession to call for southern independence and to draw attention to southern grievances.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Weapons are readily available. Incidents may not be solely criminal in nature, and may be linked to terrorism or other insecurity. Tribal disputes over land are common, including in major cities, and may involve the use of weapons. The Houthis and other militias involved in the conflict are running extra-judicial detention centres. Take care at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>The conflict also extends to Yemeni territorial waters off the Red Sea and the Bab-Al-Mandeb strait. Houthi forces continue to present a credible threat to Saudi-led Coalition vessels (including to merchant vessels flagged to Coalition states) operating off the western coast of Yemen. There is an enduring risk to neutral shipping in the Southern Red Sea due to the potential for misidentification and miscalculation by Houthi forces.</p>\n\n<p>British flagged commercial shipping is updated on International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code Security Levels from the Department for Transport.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy in the Gulf of Aden continues to be suppressed but there remains a threat. For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea page</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>President Hadi escaped Houthi-imposed house arrest on 20 February 2015 and has now established a government-in-exile in Riyadh. On 25 March 2015 a coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, began air strikes in Yemen following the request for support from President Hadi to deter continued Houthi aggression. The UN is facilitating peace talks between the Yemeni parties to the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Air strikes and ground fighting continue throughout the country to the present day. Much of the fighting is concentrated around established front lines but these do change at short notice and there is a high risk of violent clashes in all parts of Yemen.</p>\n\n<p>Further reports of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances raise concerns, as Houthis have carried out a wave of arrests of their opponents, and the list of abductees includes politicians, journalists, academics and activists. The political and security situation remains uncertain and volatile.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Yemen. The threat is heightened where AQAP have strong tribal connections and in more isolated governorates like Hadramawt and Shabwah.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Future attacks could be indiscriminate, including - but not limited to - places visited by foreigners like hotels and supermarkets, transport, oil and gas infrastructure, government buildings and Houthi gatherings. Since October 2014, there have been a number of large-scale attacks against the Houthis. Maritime and aviation terrorism also can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks targeting or affecting British nationals of Yemeni origin also can\u2019t be ruled out. Attacks against Yemeni security forces and Houthis throughout the country continue to rise and are expected to continue as a result of their ongoing Yemeni operations against AQAP.</p>\n\n<p>Methods of attack have included complex attacks by militants, firearm assassinations, kidnappings, car bombs, and improvised explosive devices (IEDS) left in locations like buildings and roadways.</p>\n\n<p>Daesh\u2019s official branch in Yemen, (Daesh-Yemen), launched its terrorist campaign in March 2015, carrying out co-ordinated suicide attacks against Shia mosques and targets in the cities of Sadah and Sana\u2019a. Since March 2015, the group has conducted dozens of terrorist attacks across the country as part of their campaign. Attacks have taken place in locations including Aden, Sana\u2019a, Ibb, Hodeida and al-Bayda. Methods of attack have included car bombings and suicide bomb attacks. The group have so far focused on Houthi, security forces and Yemeni government targets, but western interests are highly likely to be regarded as a legitimate target too.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a very high and constant threat of kidnap across Yemen. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Yemen in the last 15 years. In 2014, a number of foreign nationals were kidnapped. In February 2014, 2 British nationals were kidnapped in Yemen.  One was released in July 2014, the other in August 2015. An American national was murdered by his hostage takers during a failed rescue attempt in December 2014.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Yemen against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should pay careful attention to your safety and security. Security precautions do not remove the threat and our advice remains against all travel to the country.</p>\n\n<p>Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) propaganda has called for continued kidnapping of westerners. However, armed tribes and criminal groups have also carried out kidnaps in the past. There is a high risk that such groups would sell any hostages on to AQAP, who have murdered a number of hostages.</p>\n\n<p>Kidnaps have occurred at various times of day and in a wide variety of locations, including public places in the capital, cars while travelling, and the victims\u2019 accommodation. Kidnapping attempts often involve the use of force and have ended in the death of several victims.</p>\n\n<p>Any international presence (including UN, NGOs, oil and gas workers, journalists, teachers, students, tourists, long-term residents, and westerners of Yemeni origin) are viewed as legitimate targets if an opportunity arises. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to terrorist hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government\u2019s understanding of the rules currently in place.
