If you\u2019re bushwalking or exploring national parks it can take hours to get help in the event of an emergency. The terrain and intense heat can have a severe impact on your capabilities.

There have been cases of British nationals being injured by diving into water which was too shallow. Make sure that there is sufficient depth of water before diving, and always follow warning signs if present.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"diving-safety\">Diving safety</h3>\n\n<p>There have been several snorkelling accidents involving British nationals and other foreign tourists, some of them fatal.</p>\n\n<p>You are required by law to complete a medical declaration for resort diving or snorkelling \u2013 these, and more detailed advice, can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/132838/safety-information-for-divers-and-snorkellers-english.pdf\">Workplace Health &amp; Safety Queensland</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>For your own health and safety, you must be truthful about any medical conditions you have.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Australia using your UK driving licence as long as you remain a temporary overseas visitor; your UK licence is valid; you haven\u2019t been disqualified from driving anywhere; and your licence is not suspended or cancelled, or your visiting driving privileges withdrawn.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to stay in Australia and you hold a permanent visa, you can drive using your UK licence for a maximum of 3 months. To continue driving, you must get  a local licence within this 3 month period.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry your driving licence and passport when driving. Make sure you have sufficient insurance, including if you borrow a car from a friend or relative. Hire car insurance often doesn\u2019t cover driving on unsealed roads; check your policy before you set off.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 1,195 road deaths in the Australia (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>).

Driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs is illegal. The penalties can be severe. You must wear a seat belt at all times.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re hiring a car immediately on arrival be extra careful - you will be jetlagged and tired from your flight. Take regular rest breaks when driving long distances; there are many rest stops provided.</p>\n\n<p>Prepare thoroughly if driving in remote outback areas, which can present unexpected hazards. Ensure you have a roadworthy vehicle fitted with GPS and two spare tyres. Take good maps and extra food, water and fuel. Plan your route carefully and seek local advice before you set out. Leave your route details and expected time of return with the local tourist authorities, police, your hotel/hostel, or friends and relatives and let them know when you\u2019ve arrived safely.</p>\n\n<p>Check road conditions before beginning your journey; stay with your vehicle if it breaks down; and avoid travelling in extreme heat conditions. Sudden storms and strong winds can make driving difficult. Take particular care when driving on unsealed roads, 4WD tracks and desert/beach roads. Northern Territory Police have in the past warned tourists to stay off unsealed tracks in remote areas of Central Australia following reports of stranded motorists.</p>\n\n<p>Following a number of serious accidents, all vehicles on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/fraser/\">Fraser Island</a> must observe a maximum speed of 80km/h on beaches and 30km/h in towns. 4WD vehicles must carry no more than 8 occupants (including the driver) and all luggage must be carried inside the vehicle. Avoid driving at night and be aware of beach hazards like ditches created by the surf. Fraser Island is unique but remote, and emergency services can take many hours to reach an accident. Carry a well-stocked first-aid kit and personal medication as there is no pharmacy on the island.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-phones\">Mobile phones</h3>\n\n<p>The mobile phone network generally works well in cities and large towns but coverage elsewhere can be very limited or non-existent. If you\u2019re travelling to remote areas, check with your phone provider about coverage. You can use your UK mobile phone in Australia if global roaming has been activated, but making and receiving calls can be expensive. Many visitors prefer to buy an Australian SIM card on arrival.
