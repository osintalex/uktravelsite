Security forces have been deployed and there have been reports of the use of live rounds to disperse demonstrators in Lusaka, resulting in the death of a passer-by on 15 February 2020. The unrest follows a series of attacks on private residences, schools and other properties, some of which have included the use of gas by perpetrators. You should be vigilant, make sure your accommodation is secure and check security arrangements in your local area. If you\u2019re affected by an incident involving gas, seek medical assistance immediately and report it to the local authorities. Monitor local media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/zambia/email-signup\">this travel advice</a> for updates.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of individuals being targeted by vigilante groups in urban and rural areas on suspicion of being responsible for these attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations and protests occasionally take place in Zambia, more commonly in Lusaka and other urban areas. They can disrupt local transport, and have the potential to escalate into violence. Don\u2019t attempt to cross protester roadblocks as this commonly provokes a violent reaction from demonstrators.</p>\n\n<p>Protests and large gatherings can happen without warning and occasionally result in disorder. You should avoid them and leave the scene as soon as possible if a crowd develops. You should exercise caution and follow the guidance and instructions of local authorities.

However, serious crimes can and do occur, like armed robberies, home invasions and sexual assault. It is important to remain vigilant at all times. Vehicle hijackings happen across the country from time to time. Take particular care when approaching locked gateways at night. Don\u2019t stop to give lifts to people at the roadside. Watch out for objects that have been placed to block the road.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant, keep all vehicle doors locked and windows closed when driving, and remain aware of your surroundings, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Bag snatching, pick pocketing and theft from parked cars are common at some restaurants and internet cafes in downtown areas, particularly near bus and railway stations and in some shopping areas. Keep large amounts of money, expensive jewellery, cameras and phones out of sight. Don\u2019t change large sums of money in busy public areas. Thieves have followed people after they have withdrawn money from banks and later robbed them at gunpoint.</p>\n\n<p>Security risks increase after dark, especially in tourist areas and city centres.</p>\n\n<p>Keep valuables and originals of important documents in a safe place and carry a copy of your passport and immigration permit.</p>\n\n<p>Use reputable banks, bureaux de change or ATMs to exchange money.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>Take care when travelling in rural parts of North Western, Copperbelt, Central and Luapula provinces close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), particularly after dark. Using legitimate border crossings in these areas is generally safe, although Congolese officials may ask for payment to cross the border. Avoid travelling in the bush along this border for hunting or prospecting.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nThere is a risk of explosive remnants of war in remote areas near the borders with Angola, Mozambique and DRC. Take care if you venture off road in these areas.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nWild animals in the bush, including venomous snakes, are unpredictable and do kill. Whether you are travelling on land or water, you are at risk of potentially fatal animal attacks. Always observe local regulations and follow your tour or safari guide\u2019s instructions.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nAdventure sports, including in the Victoria Falls area, carry risks.\u00a0Serious accidents and deaths sometimes occur. The quality of medical care varies greatly. Follow safety instructions closely and make sure your insurance policy covers you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence for up to 90 days. If you intend to stay longer, you will need to get an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> or a Zambian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving. Vehicles are often poorly lit, inadequately maintained and badly driven. Drink driving and driving while talking on a mobile phone is illegal but commonplace. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rtsa.org.zm/\">The Road Traffic and Safety Agency</a> will prosecute traffic offenders through a fast track court system. \n\u00a0<br>\nRoad travel at night in rural areas can be hazardous. Abandoned vehicles, pedestrians and stray animals are a danger. Many roads are severely pot-holed or otherwise unsafe, especially during the rainy season (November-April) when bridges and roads risk being washed away by sudden floods. There are frequent fatal crashes. Don\u2019t drive at night outside the main towns.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nTravel by long-distance public transport can be dangerous due to poor standards of driving, lack of rest periods for drivers, the poor quality of vehicles and poor road conditions. Minibuses used in urban areas are usually severely overcrowded, poorly maintained and badly driven.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air Travel</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.
