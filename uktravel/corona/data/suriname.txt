Pick pocketing and robbery are increasingly common in the major business and shopping districts in the capital. You should avoid wearing expensive jewellery or displaying large amounts of money in public. Keep valuables such as your passport, tickets, driving licence and credit cards secure and keep photocopies of these documents in a separate place. If you have a smartphone, you may consider taking photographs of important documents and storing them remotely.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid remote and secluded areas, quiet streets and quiet parks. Avoid the Palm Garden (Palmentium) area in Paramaribo at night. Apart from the entertainment centre around the Torarica Hotel, you should avoid walking at night anywhere in the city.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in the interior of the country is generally trouble-free, although there have been reports of tourists being robbed.

However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">a list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Wing Airlines have been refused permission to operate services to the EU because the airline does not meet international safety standards. A full list of airlines banned from operating within the EU is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm\">European Commission website</a>. Refusal of permission to operate is often based on inspections of aircraft at EU airports. The fact that an airline is not included in the list doesn\u2019t automatically mean that it meets the applicable safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US and Netherlands authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out.
