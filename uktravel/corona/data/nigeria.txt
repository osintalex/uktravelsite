These protests can occur spontaneously and unpredictably.  You should pay attention to media and social media reports on protest locations, minimise movements and avoid demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>The al Qaeda-linked terrorist group Jamaat al Ansar al Muslimeen fi Bilad al Sudan, better known as Ansaru, claims to have killed at least six people, kidnapped dozens, and destroyed several vehicles during an ambush along the Kaduna-Zaira highway in Kaduna State. You should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to only travel during daylight hours. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since January 2018, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) has protested regularly in central Abuja and other cities. These protests, particularly in Abuja, have the potential to turn violent. Local media reported a fatality on 21 January 2020 when police allegedly fired gunshots and tear gas to disperse protesters near the Berger roundabout in Wuse, Abuja. Tensions remain heightened. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces.</p>\n\n<p>Inter-communal violence can occur throughout Nigeria, particularly in the central belt states. You should be alert to local government announcements and media reporting, and seek advice before travelling to the affected areas. In recent months, violent incidents between farming and pastoralist communities have increased with many deaths in certain rural communities.</p>\n\n<p>Political rallies, protests and violent demonstrations can occur with little notice throughout the country. International news events can sometimes trigger anti-Western demonstrations. There is the potential for increased tension on Fridays. Keep yourself informed of developments and if you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, don\u2019t try to make your way through it. Turn round and move to safety.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re working in Nigeria, you should follow your employer\u2019s local security guidelines. You are strongly advised to take professional security advice, be vigilant at all times and review your security measures regularly. Keep others informed of your travel plans and vary your routines. Make sure your accommodation is secure and consider pre-deployment training or travelling under close protection.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant and take local advice on areas to avoid. Take particular care if you\u2019re visiting crowded public places or attending events which attract large crowds. Criminals often use these situations as cover for robbery and theft.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-nigeria\">Northern Nigeria</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to Borno State, Yobe State, Adamawa State, Gombe State, and within 20km of the border with Niger in Zamfara State.

See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to: Bauchi State, Zamfara State, Kano State, Kaduna State, Jigawa State,  Katsina State; and within 20km of the border with Niger in Sokoto &amp; Kebbi States. There is a high risk of violent attacks and inter-communal tensions can lead to outbreaks of violence.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to areas to which the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against travel, you\u2019re particularly at risk and will need a high level of security. If you\u2019re working in northern Nigeria you should make sure your employers provide an adequate level of security where you live and where you work. Make sure they regularly review security arrangements and familiarise yourself with those plans. You should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to travel only during daylight hours. Westerners have been kidnapped from protected compounds.</p>\n\n<p>Regular military operations are ongoing in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. If you live or work in Nigeria you should monitor developments in these states and announcements by the state governments as there is an increased threat of retaliatory attacks elsewhere in Nigeria as a result of these military operations.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in insurgent attacks in Borno State. Since October 2019, there has been an increasing trend of terrorist groups constructing illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes in Northern Nigeria and attacking vehicles travelling on major roads into Maiduguri, Borno State, including the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road. These attacks have directly targeted civilians, security forces and aid workers. Furthermore, 2020 has seen increased activity by terrorist groups and related violent incidents in the immediate vicinity of humanitarian hubs.  A humanitarian hub was targeted during an attack on Monguno town on 13 June 2020. This was followed by negative propaganda about humanitarian activity in the Northeast. In July, shots were fired at a UN humanitarian helicopter in the region. Local humanitarian staff were executed in an unrelated event.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in the North East against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, keep in touch with the authorities and the wider community on the security situation and make sure your procedures and contingency plans are up to date. If you are working in the North East of Nigeria you should be fully confident in your employer\u2019s ability to extract you from the North East in the event of any emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-niger-delta-states\">The Niger Delta States</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to the riverine areas (ie the river and swamp locations on or close to the coast accessible by boat, but not by road) of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River States.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to Abia State and non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers States.</p>\n\n<p>Militant groups are active across the Niger Delta area and have carried out a number of attacks on oil and gas infrastructure. There\u2019s a high risk of armed robbery, criminality and criminal kidnap in the Niger Delta area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nigeria-borders\">Nigeria borders</h3>\n<p>Additional checks are in place at the Nigeria-Benin, Nigeria-Niger and Nigeria-Cameroon land borders. If you\u2019re planning to make a land crossing from Nigeria, check with the local authorities for the latest information before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of kidnap throughout Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as protection or secure your safe release. Incidents of criminal kidnap can occur in any part of the country, at any time, with an increased risk in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the northern and Middle Belt states of Adamawa, Sokoto, Zamfara, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Nassarawa, Plateau and Yobe</li>\n  <li>the Niger Delta states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Imo and Rivers</li>\n  <li>Edo</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As well as kidnap <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism#Terrorist-kidnaps\">related to terrorism</a>, kidnapping for ransom is also common in Nigeria, with foreigners and high-profile Nigerians frequently targeted. Criminal groups target whole communities or individuals, for robbery or kidnap, sometimes along major highways. In 2019 this has been particularly prevalent on the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna highway. It also occurs along the Enugu-Awka-Onitsha expressway in Anambra.</p>\n\n<p>In the past 5 years several foreign nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped and in some cases killed. Most of these kidnaps occurred in the Niger Delta region. In 2019, there has been a spike in criminal gangs operating in Zamfara State, north-western Nigeria, and multiple abductions of locals for ransom. There is a high threat of kidnapping and other armed attacks targeting oil and gas facilities and workers in the Niger Delta region. This also applies to ships and oil rigs at sea off the coast of the Niger Delta. British nationals of Nigerian origin visiting friends and relatives are often perceived as being wealthier than locals and are at particular risk of kidnap for ransom.</p>\n\n<p>Recent incidents have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>December 2019 - a British national was kidnapped in Port Harcourt, Rivers State</li>\n  <li>July 2019 - there were reports of four Turkish nationals kidnapped in Ilorin Kwara State</li>\n  <li>April 2019 - a British national was killed by gunmen at a holiday resort in Kajuru, Kaduna state. Three other individuals were kidnapped following the attack.</li>\n  <li>April 2019 - two senior employees of the oil company Shell were kidnapped in the Delta region and were later released.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The great majority of kidnapping victims remain ordinary Nigerians, including doctors and students. Foreigners as well as Nigerian businessmen, traditional rulers and politicians are often targeted in the expectation of a high ransom reward. When arranging meetings in Nigeria make sure those who attend are known to you and hold the meeting at a secure location.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"curfews\">Curfews</h2>\n<p>There are often curfews in parts of Maiduguri, Borno State and Adamawa State. Curfews and restrictions on the movement of vehicles, can be imposed, amended and lifted at short notice throughout Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to comply with all curfews and movement restrictions could put you at significant risk. You should check with the local authorities or someone with local knowledge for up to date information on curfews and restrictions before you travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"maritime-security\">Maritime security</h2>\n<p>There have been armed robberies and incidents of piracy in Nigerian waters, the wider Gulf of Guinea, and on the rivers and harbours in the Niger Delta area. Mariners should seek professional security advice, be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Throughout Nigeria there are high levels of violent street crime including muggings, kidnappings, car-jackings and armed robbery.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals as their perceived wealth makes them an attractive victim.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant at all times, even if staying with friends and family, follow the security guidance offered by employers or hosts and limit road travel at night as far as possible. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and don\u2019t wear valuable watches, jewellery or items of sentimental value. If you suspect danger, move to a safer area.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of criminal intent to target areas around international hotels in Abuja. It is likely that these potential attacks would be carried out by armed gangs. At this time of heightened threat, avoid loitering outside hotel security cordons and be extra vigilant when travelling in their vicinity.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re caught up in an armed robbery, you should immediately comply with the attackers\u2019 demands. Those who have suffered injury or worse during such attacks have been perceived as not complying fully or quickly enough.</p>\n\n<p>A British national was tragically killed in Kaduna on Friday 19 April 2019. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> continue to advise against all but essential travel to Kaduna. You should exercise additional vigilance in crowded public places.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms including romance and friendship, business ventures and work or employment opportunities.  Scams can pose great financial risk to victims. You should be very cautious about any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. You can read more about scam or \u2018419\u2019emails and letters on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/fraud-az-419\">Action Fraud website.</a></p>\n\n<p>If you or your relatives or friends are asked to transfer money to Nigeria you should make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it. If the caller claims to be in distress, you should ask whether they have reported the incident (by phone or e-mail) to the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos.</p>\n\n<p>People have received scam e-mails claiming to be from a British High Commission office in Nigeria. If you receive an email that appears to be from any British High Commission office in Nigeria asking for bank details or money, you should immediately contact the Consular Section of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-abuja#contact-us\">British Deputy High Commission</a> in Lagos.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering fertility treatment in Nigeria, you should be cautious. There have been a number of staged fake births (commonly called \u2018miracle babies\u2019) which result in visitors being falsely led to believe they have given birth. You should be aware of the risks associated with bringing a child who is not biologically related to you into the UK without following appropriate legal procedures.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Road travel across Nigeria can be chaotic and slow moving. You should take a mobile telephone and a supply of bottled water with you when travelling by car.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Nigeria with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If you\u2019re staying longer, you will need to get a Nigerian Driver\u2019s Licence. You can contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nigeriadriverslicence.org/\">Federal Road Safety Corp</a> on their website.</p>\n\n<p>You should limit travel after dark outside city centres as far as possible; and avoid quiet and poorly lit roads. You should be particularly vigilant when sitting in traffic jams or at traffic lights. Keep car windows up and doors locked, and make sure valuables are out of sight. If you feel your vehicle is being followed, drive to the nearest place of safety (eg the nearest police station).</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care when driving outside cities and consider travelling in convoy and avoid travel after dark.</p>\n\n<p>In Lagos, eating, smoking or using a mobile phone while driving and riding a motorcycle without a helmet are prohibited. Motorists face fines or imprisonment for violations.</p>\n\n<p>There are authorised and unauthorised vehicle checkpoints throughout Nigeria. Some are for security checks, others to extort small payments of money. You should slow down at any type of checkpoint and use common sense at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Since October 2019, there has been an increasing trend of illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes in Northern Nigeria. This includes attacks on major roads into Maiduguri, Borno State, including the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road. These attacks have directly targeted civilians, security forces and aid workers.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent reports of robberies and car-jackings, some involving armed gunmen, on Nigeria\u2019s urban and rural road network.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport throughout Nigeria is dangerous. Taxis and long distance buses are often poorly maintained, uninsured and driven by unqualified drivers. Most major hotels offer cars for hire with drivers. You should use these where possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you are expecting a greeter or driver to collect you at any of Nigeria\u2019s international airports, make sure they have properly identified themselves before you set off. Bogus greeters are a problem.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5N\">website of the Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.

There is a continued threat from extremist groups operating in the region. The al Qaeda-linked terrorist group Jamaat al Ansar al Muslimeen fi Bilad al Sudan, better known as Ansaru, has previously carried out attacks and kidnappings, including that of westerners, across northern Nigeria. The most recent attack was in mid-January 2020 when Ansaru claimed to have killed at least six people, kidnapped dozens, and destroyed several vehicles during an ambush along the Kaduna-Zaira highway in Kaduna State. Details remain unclear and fatality figures may rise.</p>\n\n<p>Most attacks take place in northern and north east Nigeria; there has been an increase in insurgent attacks in Borno State. However, there have been a significant number of attacks elsewhere. Public places where crowds gather have been targeted, including places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, football viewing centres, displacement camps, transport terminals, government buildings, security and educational institutions (schools, further education colleges and universities are all regular targets), and international organisations. Attacks have taken place around religious and public holidays in public or crowded places, including places of worship as well as during election periods.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid places where there are political or other large public gatherings. Be vigilant, remain alert and pay attention to your surroundings at all times. You should follow local news reports and be alert to developments particularly around religious and public holidays. A heavy security presence often indicates areas of particularly high risk. You should avoid affected areas in the immediate aftermath of an attack. You should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to only travel during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>Recent attacks have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>22 July 2020 \u2013 5 aid workers, including staff from Action Against Hunger, the International Rescue Committee, ACTED and the REACH initiative  and the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, were executed by Islamic State West Africa (ISWA)</li>\n  <li>02 July 2020 - Shots were fired at an UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) flight in Damasak Borno State.</li>\n  <li>13 June 2020 \u2013 Insurgents attacked Monguno town, killing at least 38 civilians, and targeting the humanitarian hub located in the town</li>\n  <li>9 June 2020 \u2013 Insurgents are reported to have killed around 81 civilians in Felo village, Gubio LGA</li>\n  <li>9 February 2020 \u2013 Insurgents are reported to have killed at least 30 people and abducted women and children.

You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"terrorist-kidnaps\">Terrorist kidnaps</h2>\n\n<p>The risk of further terrorist kidnaps is high across Nigeria. This is particularly acute in the north east of the country.  Kidnaps have included humanitarian and private sector workers.</p>\n\n<p>Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) have previously shown intent and capability to conduct kidnaps in Nigeria. Foreign nationals, including humanitarian workers, are likely to be considered valid targets for kidnap. Since September 2019, there has been an increasing number of attacks on Humanitarian actors in North East Nigeria.  Areas of particular concern include northern and north eastern borders with Niger and Chad as well as more widely across Borno, Yobe, Gombe and Adamawa states in north east Nigeria, and some northern and middle belt states including Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Kogi and Niger.</p>\n\n<p>Ansaru, Boko Haram and ISWA have carried out a number of kidnaps in Nigeria. Kidnappings could occur anywhere in areas where terrorist groups have a presence. In the past five years several foreign nationals and humanitarian workers have been kidnapped in the north of Nigeria, including in Adamawa state, Bauchi state, Katsina state, Kano state and Kebbi state. Some, including two British nationals, have been killed by their captors. In December 2019, four Nigerian aid workers who had been held hostage since July were reportedly killed. In July 2020, a further five Nigerian aid workers were killed following their abduction in June 2020, in Borno state.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release. You should exercise vigilance when travelling, when in crowded public places, including religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, transport hubs and camps for displaced people. You should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to travel only during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>Jama\u2019at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da\u2019wah wa\u2019l-Jihad (JASDJ) have also taken hostages from neighbouring Cameroon and the Diffa region of Niger, and continue to maintain an intent and capability to conduct kidnaps in Chad.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"terrorist-groups-operating-in-nigeria\">Terrorist groups operating in Nigeria</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"boko-haram-and-islamic-state-west-africa-iswa\">Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA)</h3>\n\n<p>Boko Haram or JASDJ is an Islamist terrorist group operating in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.

On 12 March 2015, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) accepted a pledge of allegiance by Boko Haram. In August 2016, the group split into 2 factions: Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) and JASDJ or Boko Haram.</p>\n\n<p>ISWA is affiliated with ISIS core in Iraq and Syria and has expressed an intention to target Nigerian government, Christian and western interests. ISWA have launched a series of successful attacks against Nigerian military locations, increased their freedom of movement across Borno and Yobe states, and taken multiple hostages, including two humanitarian hostages who they executed in 2018.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ansarul-muslimina-fi-biladis-sudan-vanguard-for-the-protection-of-muslims-in-black-africa-ansaru\">Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan (Vanguard for the protection of Muslims in Black Africa) (Ansaru)</h3>\n\n<p>Ansaru is an Islamist terrorist organisation based in northern Nigeria, and is proscribed by the UK. It emerged in 2012 and is motivated by an anti-Nigerian Government and anti-Western agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Ansaru is broadly aligned with Al Qaeda. Since 2012, the group has kidnapped at least 8 hostages, mainly Europeans.

A number of western nationals including tourists, NGO workers and diplomats have been kidnapped in the Sahel over the last ten years, and several are still being held. Some, including several British nationals, have been killed by their captors. Those engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism, government or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM). Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">threat from terrorism in the Sahel region</a>.</p>\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>Homosexuality is generally viewed as unacceptable in Nigeria.

There have been numerous reports of small scale civil and criminal disturbances with incidents of violence and some deaths across Nigeria. Protests can occur spontaneously and unpredictably. You should avoid demonstrations, pay attention to media and social media reports on protest locations and minimise movements.

Most attacks occur in the north east, particularly in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States.

There have also been significant attacks in Gombe, Kano, Kaduna, Jos and Bauchi States and in the Federal capital, Abuja. Further attacks are likely. Attacks could be indiscriminate and could affect western interests as well as places visited by tourists.

See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of kidnap throughout Nigeria. Kidnaps can be motivated by criminality or terrorism, and could be carried out for financial or political gain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the risk of kidnap increases after dark. The security environment in the north east has deteriorated since 2018 and there is a heightened risk of kidnap. Kidnaps in the north east have included humanitarian and private sector workers. There are also reports that Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are continuing to actively plan to kidnap foreigners. As well as in north-east Nigeria, extremist groups operate in some northern and middle belt states including Bauchi, Gombe, Kano, Kogi, Kaduna, Niger and Adamawa. If you\u2019re working or travelling in these States then you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping.
