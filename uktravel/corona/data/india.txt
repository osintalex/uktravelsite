Reported cases of sexual assault against women and young girls are increasing; recent sexual attacks against female visitors in tourist areas and cities show that foreign women are also at risk. British women have been the victims of sexual assault in Goa, Delhi and Rajasthan and women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks involving foreign nationals have been reported. In April 2018, a Latvian woman was sexually assaulted and strangled in Thiruvallam, Kerala. More recently, in December 2018 a British woman was raped in Goa. If you\u2019re a woman travelling in India you should respect local dress codes and customs and avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day. See these <a href=\"/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">travel tips for women travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the victim of a sex crime, see <a href=\"/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad\">information for British nationals affected by rape or sexual assault abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-public-transport\">Taxis and public transport</h3>\n<p>Avoid travelling alone on public transport, or in taxis or auto-rickshaws, especially late at night. If you have to use a taxi, get one from hotel taxi ranks. Exercise caution when using unofficial transport at airports as there have been instances of British tourists becoming the victims of a scam by taxi drivers and others who offer cheap transportation and/or hotels, unwanted tours and extended taxi rides. Travellers who accept these offers have reported being threatened with violence when they have declined to pay. Official pre-paid taxi services are available from inside all terminal buildings and many hotels offer airport transfer facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Try to avoid hailing taxis on the street. If you\u2019re being collected at the airport by a hotel driver make sure they have properly identified themselves before you set off. If you book a taxi online, there\u2019s a facility whereby you can let your friends/families know the details of your journey in case of an emergency. You can send your details to pre-selected contacts who can then pinpoint your exact location. If you\u2019re the victim of abuse call 100 for police assistance or 1091 or 1096 if you\u2019re the victim of sexual harassment.</p>\n\n<p>Be particularly careful with your luggage when travelling by buses and trains, and keep your handbags safe in large crowds.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n<p>Be wary of confidence tricksters, particularly in Agra and Jaipur, who promise large amounts of cash for delivery of jewellery abroad in return for an initial deposit.

India issues various types of visas, including transit visas and e-visas.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you get the right visa for your travel and that it\u2019s valid for the purpose and duration of your stay. If you enter India on the wrong visa, you could be detained on arrival and you may be deported and blacklisted, meaning that you can\u2019t enter India again. Make sure you meet entry requirements. You can find further information on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/\">Indian High Commission website</a> or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://boi.gov.in/\">Indian Immigration Bureau website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should check your visa for any endorsements that state you should register your arrival in India within a certain amount of time. Failure to do so could lead to you being denied permission to leave.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re applying for an e-visa, check you meet the eligibility criteria. If you do not hold a full \u2018British Citizen\u2019 passport, you may not be eligible for an e-visa. You can find out more about this on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html\">India\u2019s e-visa website</a>. Beware of fake websites offering this service.</p>\n\n<p>There have been changes made by the Indian Government on visa formalities for foreigners who are hospitalised in India when travelling on a short-term tourist visa. If you or someone you are travelling with is travelling on a tourist visa and is hospitalised, get in touch with the local Foreigners Registration Office (FRO) to check if visa conversion is required.</p>\n\n<p>India\u2019s Bureau of Immigration has announced that with immediate effect, foreign nationals who arrive at an Indian port holding non-machine readable passports will be denied entry. Carriers who transport foreign passengers holding non-machine readable passports may be subject to a fine.</p>\n\n<p>Overstaying on your visa is an offence. Make sure you leave the country before your visa expires.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applicants-of-pakistani-origin\">Applicants of Pakistani origin</h3>\n<p>All applicants of Pakistani origin who hold dual British-Pakistan nationality must apply for an Indian visa on their Pakistan passport. If you have renounced your Pakistani nationality or cancelled your Pakistani passport, you will need to submit documentary proof of this.</p>\n\n<p>The processing time for visa applications received from persons of Pakistani origin is 7-8 weeks or more. Processing time for applications from those holding dual British-Pakistan nationality will be substantially longer. For further details see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/index/\">Indian High Commission website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n<p>To avoid possible problems at immigration, make sure your passport is valid for a minimum of 180 days at the time of entry into India.</p>\n\n<p>Your passport must be machine readable, with 2 blank pages for your visa and valid for a minimum of 180 days at the time of your visa application.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"airport-tax\">Airport tax</h3>\n<p>User Development Fees (UDF) apply at many airports. The fees are around Rs.1,000 per international passenger and Rs.150 to 260 per domestic passenger. This should already be included in the cost of airline tickets. If for any reason the fee is not included in your ticket it will be collected at the airport check-in counter in Indian rupees.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"polio-vaccination\">Polio vaccination</h3>\n<p>If you travel to India from Pakistan, Israel, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Afghanistan or Somalia you may be required to hold a valid polio vaccination certificate.

Ask your accommodation provider whether they\u2019re registered to file \u2018C-Forms\u2019 with the Foreigners\u2019 Registration Office (FRO). You\u2019re strongly advised to use accommodation that is registered with the FRO.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"uk-emergency-travel-documents\">UK Emergency Travel Documents</h3>\n<p>UK ETDs are valid for entry to or exit from India with the relevant Indian visa. They are also valid for airside transit. However, a holder of an ETD will not be able to both enter and exit India using the same ETD.  You should be aware that you will have to apply to the local authorities for an exit permit if you\u2019re leaving India on a passport or ETD that is different to the one on which you entered. This must be done online, and you should factor this into your timeframe to leave India. For further information visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://indianfrro.gov.in/eservices/home.jsp\">FRRO</a> website.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"overseas-citizen-of-india-oci-card-holders\">Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card holders</h3>\n<p>In March 2016, the Government of India announced that OCI card holders will no longer need a visa to enter India. The \u2018U\u2019 visa sticker that was placed in the foreign passport of OCI card holders has been discontinued with immediate effect and you\u2019ll no longer need to show this sticker to the immigration authorities when you enter and leave India. You\u2019ll only need to present a valid passport and your OCI card.

New Delhi and other North Indian cities are currently experiencing extremely high levels of pollution.
