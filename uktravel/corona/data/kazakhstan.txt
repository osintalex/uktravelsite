Attacks have largely taken place at night, in and around local nightclubs and bars or when arriving at home late at night, as the majority of apartment buildings have dark stairwells and no lifts. Avoid walking alone and where possible pre-arrange transport. Keep valuables in a safe place and out of public view. Avoid travelling in unofficial taxis, particularly at night and alone, or if there is another passenger already in the car.</p>\n\n<p>Robberies have occurred on trains, so always lock railway compartments on overnight trains.</p>\n\n<p>Passenger lists on aircraft are not always kept confidential. There have been instances of people being met from an aircraft by someone using their name and then being robbed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"closed-areas\">Closed areas</h3>\n<p>The following areas of Kazakhstan are closed to visitors unless prior permission has been received from the Foreign Ministry and the Interior Ministry, with the agreement of the Kazakh National Security Committee:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Gvardeyskiy urban-type village in Almaty region (south eastern Kazakhstan)\u00a0</li>\n  <li>the town of Baykonur</li>\n  <li>the districts of Karmakchi and Kazalinsk in southern Kyzylorda region</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"borders\">Borders</h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t cross the border into or out of Kazakhstan illegally.</p>\n\n<p>Most land borders are currently closed to foreign nationals due to Coronavirus restrictions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>If you wish to drive in Kazakhstan you should apply for a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Kazakhstan. You can get IDPs over the counter from most UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus are a single Customs Union so if you are planning to travel overland in your own vehicle make sure your customs declaration and temporary import licence are valid for the entire period of stay in all three countries. Your import licence can be extended for up to a year if necessary by contacting the customs authorities in any of the three countries.</p>\n\n<p>Service stations are limited outside the main cities. Make sure you take all you need for your journey including water. Make sure your vehicle is properly maintained and in good condition for lengthy journeys.</p>\n\n<p>Many roads are poorly maintained and road works or damaged roads are often not clearly signposted. Driving standards can be erratic. In some remote areas there are often stray animals on the roads. These are especially difficult to see in the dark. In winter, roads can become hazardous due to snow and ice.</p>\n\n<p>Local traffic police only have the right to stop vehicles if an offence has been committed, but you should obey any request from the police to stop. The police officer should complete official papers relating to any alleged offence.</p>\n\n<p>Many cars are not safely maintained and do not have rear seatbelts.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when crossing roads as pedestrian crossings are rarely respected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.

Kazakhstan\u2019s civil aviation authority has suspended the company\u2019s licence. A list of further incidents and accidents in Kazakhstan can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=UN\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Local airlines do not always run to flight schedule. Check your actual departure or arrival time in advance. Keep hold of your baggage tags, as you will need to show them when you leave the airport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Public demonstrations are only permitted when authorised in advance. Unauthorised small-scale public protests do take place occasionally, in contravention of local law, putting participants at risk of arrest. You should avoid any demonstrations or political gatherings.
