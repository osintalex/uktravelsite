Try to make contact with the police or other local authority immediately if you are involved in an accident.</p>\n\n<p>For travel outside the capital, you will need authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior, which is normally granted without difficulty after a few days.

The terrorist group Boko Haram remains active in this region. In an attack in March 2020, Boko Haram are reported to have killed at least 92 Chadian soldiers in Boma, Lac province.

If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities.

On 12 March 2015, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) accepted a pledge of allegiance by Boko Haram.

These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM).

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There\u2019s a threat of retaliatory attacks following the French intervention in Mali and due to Chad\u2019s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. There is a heightened threat of kidnap in Chad.
