The British High Commission continues to receive regular reports of British nationals who are the victims of mugging and bag snatching (especially by passing cars or motorbikes) and armed robbery and burglary have increased throughout the country. In December 2016, a European family was robbed at gun point and their campsite guard killed at South Beach, 20km southeast of Dar es Salaam. In Dar es Salaam, tourists have been kidnapped, assaulted, robbed and forced with the threat of violence to withdraw cash from ATMs and arrange cash transfers of up to \u00a35,000 through Western Union after being befriended by strangers or using unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Walk as far away from the road as possible and avoid walking and cycling at night. If you need to walk alongside the road, walk towards the traffic. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or other valuables including expensive jewellery or watches. Leave your passport in the hotel safe and carry a photocopy for ID at all times. If you\u2019re attacked, do not resist. If you carry a bag, it is safer to hold it loosely by the handle or hanging off your shoulder rather than by securing the strap across your chest. Both pedestrians and cyclists have been targeted by bag thieves. Do not accept lifts from strangers or individuals offering to procure a licensed taxi on your  behalf. Do not use unlicensed taxis. Where possible, you should arrange a taxi through a reputable establishment, for example a hotel, and you should always ask to see the driver\u2019s ID. App-based taxi services are not reliable. Avoid walking and exercising alone, particularly in isolated areas and on beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care in places frequented by tourists and expatriate residents. In Dar es Salaam, tourists and residents have been targeted in the city centre, at Ubungo bus station, the Masaki/Oysterbay peninsula area, particularly at Coco Beach and along Toure Drive. On Zanzibar incidents have taken place in Stone Town and at hotels and on popular tourist beaches throughout the island.</p>\n\n<p>There was an increase in the number of residential burglaries in Zanzibar and Arusha in 2018. Make sure residential property is secure and lock all doors and windows, especially at night.

This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Tanzania.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Tanzania can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5H\">Aviation Safety network</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel to a neighbouring country or across the region, make sure you check our travel advice for each country you intend to visit.</p>\n\n<p>Information about travel in remote areas can be patchy. Invest in an up-to-date travel guide and only use reliable tour companies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"burundi-borderkigoma-region\">Burundi border/Kigoma region</h3>\n\n<p>Take particular care in the area bordering Burundi/Kigoma region. There have been armed robberies in this area, including vehicle hijackings. Drive only in hours of daylight. There are few facilities for visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mozambique-border\">Mozambique border</h3>\n\n<p>Take particular care near the border with Mozambique. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to some districts in Cabo Delgado province, Mozambique, due to an increase in attacks by groups with links to Islamic extremism. As a result, there is a risk of cross-border tensions and instability, including a risk of violence. An attack on Kitaya village in October 2020 was claimed by Islamic extremists operating from northern Mozambique. Check our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique\">travel advice for Mozambique</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"national-parks\">National Parks</h3>\n<p>Careful planning is important to get the best out of your safari. If you choose to camp, only use official sites. Make sure you are properly equipped and seek local advice when travelling to isolated areas. Some parks are extremely remote, and emergency access and evacuation can be difficult.</p>\n\n<p>There are risks associated with viewing wildlife, particularly on foot or at close range. Always follow park regulations and wardens\u2019 advice, and make sure you have the correct documentation or permit before entering a national park.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trekking\">Trekking</h3>\n<p>If you are trekking or climbing, only use a reputable travel company, stick to established routes and always walk in groups. Make sure you are well prepared and equipped to cope with the terrain and low temperatures. The extreme altitude on Mount Kilimanjaro can cause altitude sickness.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>In the last few years there have been several ferry disasters in which hundreds of people have died. These were ferries travelling between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, between the islands of Zanzibar and in the Lake Zone area.</p>\n\n<p>Use a reputable ferry company and if you believe a ferry to be overloaded or unseaworthy, do not get on. Familiarise yourself with emergency procedures on board and make a note of where the life jackets and emergency exits are located.</p>\n\n<p>You should also beware of aggressive ticket touts at Tanzanian ports.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://on-shore.mschoa.org/\">designated High Risk  Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.

From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are generally poor and driving standards are erratic. There are a large number of accidents, often involving inter-city buses. There have been a number of serious bus crashes that have resulted in fatalities and injuries to tourists. If you have concerns about the safety of the vehicle, or the ability of the driver, use alternative transport.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive yourself during a visit to Tanzania, you\u2019ll need your UK licence and an International Driving Permit. To drive in Zanzibar you\u2019ll need your UK licence and a local Zanzibar driving permit (which you can get through your hire car company). Carry several copies of your driving licence, permits and insurance documents.</p>\n\n<p>Self-driving in Tanzania can be challenging and the quality of car hire companies is variable. Consider using reputable taxis as an alternative. There are no roadside rescue or breakdown services. Road maps are hard to come by and not always up to date. Service stations are infrequent and may not have supplies of fuel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving conditions in Tanzanian\u2019s national parks can be unpredictable as the roads around the parks, mainly dirt tracks, are generally poor and can become hazardous or impassable after heavy rain. A 4x4 vehicle is often required. Avoid driving out of major towns and cities at night.</p>\n\n<p>Keep doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, as vehicles are sometimes targeted by thieves. Be particularly careful at night when there is a higher incidence of crime and drunk driving. Avoid driving out of town at night. If you become aware of an unusual incident, or if somebody in plain clothes tries to flag you down, it is often safer not to stop.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent police road blocks. If you\u2019re stopped by the police, ask to see identification before making any payments for traffic violations. If you\u2019re involved in a road accident, co-operate with the local police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"train-travel\">Train travel</h3>\n<p>There have been several accidents on Tanzanian railways. Seek local advice for any long-distance train travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n\n<p>General elections are scheduled to take place on 28 October 2020.  We expect these to take place peacefully. You should avoid all demonstrations and rallies. On occasion, demonstrations and political rallies  across Tanzania (including on the islands of Unguja (Zanzibar) and Pemba) have turned violent and resulted in fatalities. Police may use tear gas and/or live ammunition for crowd control. Keep up to date with local and international events and avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.
