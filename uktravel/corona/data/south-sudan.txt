Weapons are plentiful and easily obtained in South Sudan and criminals are often armed. Many armed men who are without jobs or have not been paid are resorting to criminality. Drive-by thefts by individuals or groups on motorbikes have been reported.</p>\n\n<p>Although the number of aid workers killed in targeted attacks has reduced in recent years, South Sudan remains one of the most dangerous operating environments for aid workers in the world. Incidents of violence, intimidation, arbitrary detentions and kidnappings are reported, although these have mostly affected South Sudanese or regional nationals. In total, at least 115 have been killed since the conflict began in 2013. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to South Sudan, however if you decide to travel, you should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>The government has imposed significant restrictions on internal travel between states in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (April to October/November) most roads outside of Juba become impassable, and some parts of the country can become inaccessible.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of intercommunal violence in some parts of the country, and there are sporadic reports of fighting between armed groups in certain areas. Criminal attacks have taken place on the main Juba-Nimule road, which is one of the main supply routes from Uganda into South Sudan. There are reports of mines and unexploded ordnance in parts of the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re currently in South Sudan you should exercise your own judgment, based on your knowledge of the local situation, media reporting, or advice from the UN. Our advice is that you should leave South Sudan immediately if it\u2019s safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Our ability to provide assistance outside Juba is severely limited. If you\u2019re concerned about your safety, you should contact the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> on +44 207 008 5000 or by email at <a href=\"mailto:crisis@fcdo.gov.uk\">crisis@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Driving conditions and standards in South Sudan are well below those in the UK and other European countries. Very few roads are surfaced and maintained, particularly outside Juba. Residential areas usually have dirt roads. At night, there is almost no street lighting and many vehicles have no lights. Roads are used by pedestrians, donkey-carts and rickshaw-style cabs, as well as motor vehicles. Checkpoints, manned by armed men, are common around Juba, especially after dark.  There are regular reports of money being demanded from drivers, and of people (especially women) being physically abused at these checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>The use of public transport should be avoided, due to the unsafe condition of vehicles, the regular occurrence of road traffic accidents (particularly on the Juba-Nimule road), and the high risk of robbery or assault on foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Although drivers should have a licence and insurance, many don\u2019t have these. Make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can find a list of incidents and accidents on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=STss\">Aviation Safety network</a>. An internal flight by a South Sudanese airline crashed in March 2017, although there were no fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of every individual airline, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices.</p>\n\n<p>This list isn\u2019t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Following 5 years of internal conflict a peace agreement was signed in 2018 which has led to a significant reduction in violence; but slow and uneven implementation mean that the political and security situation remains potentially volatile. The impact of the conflict, at both a national and local level, combined with a series of natural disasters (including flooding in late 2019 and the ongoing East Africa locust infestation) drives a dire humanitarian situation across the country that risks being exacerbated by coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to remain in the country, you should follow political developments closely, and observe any curfews in place. In the event of civil disorder, stay at home and restrict your movements as much as possible, especially after dark. Avoid public gatherings, political rallies and protests.</p>\n\n<p>There are credible reports of border incursions and engagements involving armed actors along all of South Sudan\u2019s frontiers, and you should exercise extreme caution in the country\u2019s border areas. A US-UK journalist was killed in August 2017 near the town of Kaya close to the Ugandan border during a gunfight between government forces and armed rebels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"economic-situation\">Economic situation</h3>\n\n<p>The economy remains in decline, and further seriously impacted by  coronavirus, which increases the prospect of armed men turning to criminality, especially in Juba and other main centres. Extortion at checkpoints by armed men, particularly after dark, can be common. South Sudan is an extremely difficult environment for businesses and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to operate in. There are regular reports of foreign nationals being subject to harassment and crime, including sexual assault.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorist attacks in South Sudan can\u2019t be ruled out.
