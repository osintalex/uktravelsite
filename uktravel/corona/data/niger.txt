Thefts, robberies and residential break-ins can occur at any time. The main type of incident for which British nationals need consular assistance in Niger is theft. Take sensible precautions to keep important items like money, passports, jewellery and mobile phones safe. The areas around the Gaweye Hotel, National Museum and Petit March\u00e9 in Niamey are particularly prone to muggings and you should not walk alone there, or cross the Kennedy Bridge on foot at any time.  Walking at night is dangerous due to the lack of street lighting.</p>\n\n<p>Car thieves often target off-road vehicles. Make sure car doors are locked at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Banditry, smuggling and other criminal activity is common in border areas, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Bandits are thought to be operating in the border area with Nigeria south of Zinder. You should take special care and avoid crossing the border with Nigeria during the hours of darkness.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been incidents of Nigeriens being killed in the course of hold-ups and robberies on public transport buses travelling between Tahoua and Agadez and between Agadez and Arlit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/fraudalert/\">scams</a>.   The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>Travel around Niger can be difficult, and conditions are poor for overland travel. You should take all necessary safety precautions, especially outside of main urban areas, have confidence in your security arrangements and maintain a high level of vigilance.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid all travel between towns at night. Seek local advice and use local travel agents and guides when travelling outside main towns and in desert areas. An approved local travel agent can arrange all the necessary permits for your journey and leave details of your itinerary with the local authorities. Travel in convoy and carry an independent satellite phone when travelling off the beaten track. You should prepare well in advance and make sure you have a sufficient supply of drinking water and food.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-and-eastern-niger\">Northern and eastern Niger</h3>\n<p>Local authorities are extremely sensitive about foreigners travelling out of Tahoua to other parts of Niger in the east and the north. There is a risk of arrest and deportation for even enquiring about travel to Agadez, given the security situation in that region.</p>\n\n<p>The following roads in northern Niger are permanently closed to tourists, except with special authorisation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Chirfa (Djado) / Djanet (Algeria)</li>\n  <li>Achouloma (north Djado) / Salvador Pass (Libya)</li>\n  <li>Adrar Bous (north A\u00efr) / Djanet (Algeria)</li>\n  <li>Adrar Bous (north A\u00efr) / In Azawa (Algeria)</li>\n  <li>Agadez / Arlit / Iferouane</li>\n  <li>Agadez / Tahoua</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The MNJ armed group has launched attacks in the north including the use of land mines, and Islamist terrorist groups have recently launched attacks in Agadez, Arlit and against a prison in Niamey. The Governor of the city of Agadez has banned vehicles without a security forces escort from leaving the city after 4pm. Attacks against tourists are known to take place at El Meki between Agadez and Timia. The A\u00efr and T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 regions are particularly prone to attacks.</p>\n\n<p>A curfew has been implemented in the whole of the Diffa region since 2014. As of 19 April 2019, this prohibits the movement of motorised vehicles from 7pm to 5am.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"western-niger\">Western Niger</h3>\n<p>A state of emergency has been in place in the urban municipality of Tillab\u00e9ri since February 2019.  The movement of motorcycles and cars is banned from 7pm to 6am, and the movement of pedestrians is banned from 10pm to 6am. Public meetings are banned, unless expressly permitted by the authorities.

Seek local advice before making this journey.</p>\n\n<p>Buses operate on routes between Niamey and other large towns, but distances are long and buses are prone to mechanical failure.

This was in response to an escalation in terrorist attacks, especially in the Tillab\u00e9ri region.</p>\n\n<p>There have been multiple recent attacks in Niger, particularly in the Diffa and Tillab\u00e9ri regions. Notable recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 9 August, gunmen killed 8 people, including 6 French nationals, at a giraffe reserve in Kour\u00e9</li>\n  <li>on 9 January 2020, terrorists killed 89 Nigerien soldiers at their base in Chinegodrar, Tillab\u00e9ri</li>\n  <li>on 10 December 2019, terrorists killed 71 Nigerien soldiers at their base in Inates</li>\n  <li>on 1 July 2019, terrorists killed at least 18 Nigerien soldiers at an army base in Tillab\u00e9ri</li>\n  <li>on 19 June 2019, gunmen killed 2 police officers at the north Niamey Gates</li>\n  <li>on 16 May 2019, terrorists killed 28 Nigerien soldiers in Tillab\u00e9ri</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is also a risk of terrorist attacks in the Parc du W, which is tri-national and shares an open border with Benin and Burkina Faso. Terrorist activity is increasing in south-eastern Burkina Faso, including confirmed terrorist attacks in the Parc. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>) therefore advise against all travel to the Parc plus the contiguous Dosso and Tamou hunting zones.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n<p>There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM). Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards. <a href=\"/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">Read more about the threat from terrorism in the Sahel region</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Westerners have been kidnapped in Niger and the wider Sahel region, including in Niamey and the north and west of Niger. In September 2018, a Catholic priest was kidnapped in Makolondi, 125 km southwest of Niamey. An aid worker was kidnapped in the Tillaberi region of Niger in April 2018. In October 2016, an aid worker was kidnapped in Abalak, 350 km northeast of Niamey.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re working or travelling in Niger, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling, in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, nature reserves and national parks, and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>Niger is a Muslim country.
