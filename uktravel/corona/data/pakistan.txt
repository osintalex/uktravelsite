Crowded areas such as the Red Mosque (Lal Masjid) and Aabpara Market in G6 have been a focal point for protests in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"karachi\">Karachi</h3>\n<p>Karachi has seen an improvement in the overall security situation in recent years. However, the city is still prone to high levels of violence, and the safety of daily activity can be unpredictable. It is vulnerable to violent ethnic conflict between different communities. Criminal and political violence is also common including armed carjacking, robbery, kidnap and murder. Strikes called by various religious and political parties are capable of causing significant disruption across the city and can occasionally lead to violent civil unrest. Smaller scale labour strikes are also a common occurrence and cause regular disruptions on a more localised scale.</p>\n\n<p>Despite a general improvement, terrorist related activity still occurs in Karachi. Public service and health officials have also been subject to attacks in the past whilst delivering health programmes. There is also a risk of violence in parts of the city which include government offices. Major hotels and the financial district are generally regarded as more stable, though there remains a risk of violence, particularly following Friday prayers.</p>\n\n<p>You should carefully plan any travel within the city, taking into account all the threats. You should take advice from hosts or trusted contacts, abide by direction from law enforcement officers and be prepared to cancel or curtail your plans. Lyari, Malir, Quaidabad and Orangi Town have a greater risk of violence based on past activity.

You are strongly advised to obtain and follow local security advice and make appropriate personal security arrangements in advance of any visit. There are also occasional outbursts of sectarian violence in and around Gilgit.</p>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals must register with the local authorities when visiting Gilgit-Baltistan. You may need a permit for mountaineering or trekking, in particular for mountains over 6,000 metres. The process can take up to 2 months and is best organised through a travel company. The validity of your travel insurance policy may be affected if you don\u2019t have the correct permits.</p>\n\n<p>Use reputable trekking agencies, stay on established routes, and always walk in groups.

You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistan has a modern and efficient motorway system between the major cities. The quality of other roads is more variable. Take particular care on long road journeys and when travelling cross-country. Local driving standards are erratic, especially at night. Road conditions can be poor and there is a risk of carjacking.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using street taxis. Only use taxis from reputable companies which are radio-controlled.</p>\n\n<p>For security reasons, you should avoid using public transport, including the Metro Bus which operates between Rawalpindi and Islamabad.</p>\n\n<p>The north of Pakistan is mountainous, with some of the highest peaks in the world contained within this area. As a result many roads are inaccessible at certain times of the year due to extreme weather conditions, and landslides frequently block or destroy roads.

The main terrorist threat comes from Tehrik-e Taleban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella organisation of groups primarily based in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Daesh is also active. While both groups\u2019 activities are primarily directed against the Pakistani state, they have in the past stated an intent to launch attacks on western interests. TTP and Daesh conduct attacks throughout Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Further attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Previous methods of attack have included grenades, shootings, bombings and suicide bombs. Militants can launch complex and deadly attacks. Be vigilant, keep a low profile and vary your routes and timings if you make any regular journeys. You should avoid large organised gatherings which may expose you to higher risk, such as public protests, religious gatherings and processions, and political rallies. Courts and government buildings, security facilities or personnel can also be the target of attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners, in particular westerners, may be directly targeted. Densely populated and unsecured areas, such as markets, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, airports, public transport, schools and educational institutions are potential focal points for attacks. Additionally, take care if you\u2019re planning to attend sporting events or live music venues. Attacks have previously targeted places that could be considered by militants to be un-Islamic, including CD/DVD shops and barber shops. In recent years, the Pakistani authorities have reintroduced major sporting events into the country, including the Pakistan Super League in cricket.  Increased security measures are in place at these events. You should be extra vigilant at all times in such areas, follow the advice of security personnel and minimise your exposure to areas that pose a higher risk.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistani government personnel and institutions, and the security forces, including police, are prime targets for attacks, especially given the ongoing Pakistan military action in the areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province formerly referred to as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), which may lead to retaliatory attacks. Avoid key government installations and gatherings of uniformed personnel, and be vigilant in areas around diplomatic premises throughout Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Places of worship, including churches, religious sites, minority religious sects and shrines are often targeted. You should avoid religious events or gatherings and limit movements on Friday afternoons. During holy periods/religious holidays there may be a higher risk of targeted attacks, including on western interests and religious minorities.</p>\n\n<p>Areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, suffer regular terrorist attacks. There are reports that extremists may look to carry out attacks in the districts of Dir and Chitral, including targeting foreign nationals. There are threats of attacks in Karachi and almost daily violence.</p>\n\n<p>Areas of Balochistan, including Quetta, also experience frequent attacks. There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep track of the news. Incidents can occur and the security situation can deteriorate quickly. There may be increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n<p>You should be alert to the threat of kidnapping throughout Pakistan. Kidnappings can be for financial or political gain.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals of Pakistani origin are at particular risk of kidnap for ransom. British and other foreign national kidnap victims have faced extended periods of detention. While some were ultimately released by their captors, others have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers.
