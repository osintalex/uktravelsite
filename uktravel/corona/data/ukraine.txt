You should avoid all demonstrations and take extra care at public gatherings. Policing of these events may include road closures. The situation in Kyiv and other areas outside Donetsk and Luhansk is generally calm. In Kyiv, the areas around Maydan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) and government buildings such as the Verkhovna Rada (parliament building) and the National Bank of Ukraine are most frequently affected.</p>\n\n<p>Pay close attention to your personal security and monitor the media for information about possible safety or security risks.

According to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl\">International Atomic Energy Agency</a>, although some of the radioactive isotopes released into the atmosphere still linger, they are at tolerable exposure levels for limited periods of time.

Following an illegal referendum on 16 March 2014, Russia illegally annexed Crimea on 21 March 2014 and tensions remain high.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian International Airlines have cancelled all flights to and from Simferopol.</p>\n\n<p>All train and official bus services to Crimea have been cancelled.\nTo enter or exit Crimea, foreign nationals will need to provide their passport and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://uk.mfa.gov.ua/en/press-center/comments/3952-rules-on-entry-into-and-exit-from-crimea\">a special permit</a> issued by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://dmsu.gov.ua/en-home/services/documenting-foreigners/granting-of-special-permits-to-enter-crimea.html\">territorial body of the State Migration Service of Ukraine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The European Union <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/\">has imposed restrictions</a> on economic relations with Crimea following its illegal annexation by Russia.

Exports of further key goods for certain sectors are also banned.</p>\n\n<p>The Crimean sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Feodosia, Yalta and Yevpatoria have been designated by the Ukrainian authorities as closed to international shipping.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Most visitors to Ukraine experience no difficulties. Serious crime against foreigners is relatively rare, but incidents do occur. In some cases attacks have been racially motivated. Travellers of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent and individuals belonging to religious minorities should take extra care.</p>\n\n<p>You should report any incidents to the police by dialling 102.\u00a0A list of local translators is available on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukraine-list-of-interpreters\">British Embassy website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possibility of street crime and petty theft, which is on the increase in Kyiv. Foreigners may appear to be lucrative targets. Where possible, avoid walking alone late at night in dark or poorly lit streets. Keep valuables and cash safe and out of sight, especially in crowded areas, tourist spots, and public transport, where pickpockets and bag snatchers operate.</p>\n\n<p>A common scam is to drop a wallet or bundle of money in front of a tourist. The criminal then \u201cfinds\u201d the money and asks if it is the tourist\u2019s or offers to share the money with them. If you are approached in this way, you should walk away without engaging in conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t lose sight of your credit cards during transactions.</p>\n\n<p>Some British nationals have reported being charged inflated prices in bills from bars, cafes and restaurants. If you have any concerns, take care to confirm the price before ordering and check the bill and receipt against the price of ordered items from the menu.</p>\n\n<p>Theft of and from vehicles is common. Don\u2019t leave documents or money in your vehicle. Unregulated taxi drivers can overcharge. Use official taxis, which have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and on the top of the taxi.</p>\n\n<p>Do not leave drinks or food unattended as they could be spiked. Beware of accepting drinks from casual acquaintances.</p>\n\n<p>Exercise caution when travelling to Ukraine for a relationship initiated via the internet. There have been incidents of marriage fraud and attempted extortion affecting foreign nationals. You should be particularly vigilant if the person is uncontactable face-to-face or they ask you to send money urgently (for example, they may say that they\u2019ve been arrested or have fallen ill). Unfortunately it\u2019s very unlikely you\u2019ll be able to recover your money if you\u2019re a victim of such a scam.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n<p>You must have a valid <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> to drive legally in Ukraine, as well as your UK driving licence. You will need to have the 1968 permit to drive in Ukraine. 1949 permits previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Ukraine. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have original vehicle-registration papers, ownership documents and insurance papers available at all times. These will be required if you are stopped by the police and when crossing borders. This also applies to rental vehicles. If you do not have these papers when stopped by the police they have the right to impound your vehicle and charge you for this.</p>\n\n<p>For information regarding bringing your car to Ukraine, see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine/entry-requirements#bringing-your-car-to-ukraine\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-hire\">Car hire</h3>\n<p>If you intend to rent a vehicle for your travel to Ukraine, you should check with the car hire company and insurance company their policy on renting cars in Ukraine and any other country you will pass through, especially non-EU countries. Ensure they provide you with a rental agreement permitting you to cross the border into Ukraine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n<p>Local driving standards are poor. Street lights are weak, speed limits, traffic lights and road signs are often ignored, and drivers rarely indicate before manoeuvring. There are a high number of traffic accidents, including fatalities. Speeding, drink driving and infrequent use of helmets, seat belts and child restraints in vehicles are the main contributing factors.</p>\n\n<p>In case of a road accident dial 102. Local officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are of variable quality. Driving outside major towns at night can be hazardous. Avoid night-time travel wherever possible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n<p>You must wear a seat belt. Using a mobile phone while driving is prohibited. There is a zero limit on drinking alcohol and driving.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian law allows the police to stop a vehicle. The police officer should give their name and rank, explain why you have been stopped and make an administrative offence report. The police may film interactions with members of the public. Fines can be levied for minor offences such as illegal parking or jumping a red light. The police may be carrying a credit card terminal to collect payment on the spot, or fines may be paid online or at a bank within 15 days.
