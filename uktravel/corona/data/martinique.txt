Visitors travelling (or being air lifted) to Martinique from other non-French islands specifically for medical treatment should be aware that such treatment will not necessarily be covered.\u00a0Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning a permanent move to Martinique, consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for advice on\u00a0long-term entitlement as residents to health care provision under the French national system.
