There have been reports of robberies involving violence, handbag snatching, pick-pocketing, distraction thefts and harassment, particularly around the central market and local beaches. There has been a recent increase in the number of house burglaries. Make sure you have effective security in place.</p>\n\n<p>Civil unrest and drunken behaviour can occur. Foreigners and expatriates may be attractive targets for violence. Take care if going to local nightclubs and be aware that such venues rarely have adequate fire precautions in place.</p>\n\n<p>Take sensible security precautions at all times, and maintain a high state of personal awareness. Be especially vigilant whilst travelling around Honiara at night particularly if on foot. Take particular care in the squatter settlements around Honiara, White River and the Lungga Bridge, Sun Valley, Mataniko Bridge, Burns Creek and Henderson (airport) area. Security incidents in these areas have included improvised road blocks, sporadic rock throwing and more serious violent criminal acts, including sexual assault, robbery and vehicle hijacking. If you plan to visit rural Guadalcanal, take day trips outside Honiara or visit the island of Malaita you should check local advice before travelling. Visits to other provinces in Solomon Islands are generally trouble-free.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>There are few roads in Solomon Islands; 90% of these are on Guadalcanal and Malaita. Many are very heavily potholed and in some areas bridges have collapsed. Standards of driving and vehicle maintenance are poor. Be especially careful when overtaking. Many Solomon Islanders chew betel nut and frequently open vehicle doors, including on the driver\u2019s side, when travelling at speed, in order to spit onto the road. Take care when driving in and around town. Poor pedestrian discipline and speeding has resulted in a number of fatal accidents. Driving at night requires even more care as there is little street lighting.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a road accident the law requires you to stop and stay at the scene until the police arrive. There may however be circumstances where this is not safe, for example if a large and hostile crowd has gathered. In this case, it may be preferable to drive to the nearest police station to report the incident.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Reliability of services can be patchy and cancellations occur. Domestic flights are particularly prone to disruption and visitors with international connections should take note and plan accordingly. Facilities at Henderson International Airport are well below those at most international airports and you should prepare accordingly. International flight departures are to Brisbane, Nadi, Port Moresby, Tarawa and Port Vila.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>You should avoid travel on inter-island ferries wherever possible. Ferry services are usually crowded and safety regulations are not always strictly applied. Some domestic inter-island passenger ferries are operated at a nationally acceptable standard, but most domestic shipping is operated at a standard that would not be acceptable to an international traveller, and few carry recognised insurance.  You should check with the operator before embarking. Bring your own lifejacket if you are taking sea journeys. Journeys to small and/or remote islands are usually in small-motorised canoes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dangerous-wildlife\">Dangerous wildlife</h3>\n<p>Salt water crocodiles are native to many parts of Solomon Islands, and there are regular sightings on beaches. Take local advice before entering unfamiliar waters, including lakes. There are also large species of shark (such as bull, hammerhead and tiger sharks) in the coastal waters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-sports\">Water sports</h3>\n<p>Many visitors to Solomon Islands take part in water sports, including scuba diving and snorkelling without incident. However, deaths and serious accidents have occurred because basic safety measures weren\u2019t taken. Safety precautions and emergency responses may be less than those expected in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a decompression chamber in Honiara staffed by volunteers. Registered dive operators can provide information on access arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance policy covers you for the activities you take part in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"communications\">Communications</h3>\n<p>There are two mobile telephone networks operating in Solomon Islands. Coverage is variable but does extend to the outer provinces and is becoming more extensive. Contact your service provider for further details. Your UK mobile phone is highly unlikely to work in the Solomon Islands. Local SIM cards and handsets are available. Solomon Telekom offers a hire service for satellite phones. Mobile 4G internet services are available in Honiara.
