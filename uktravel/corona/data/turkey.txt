Find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">global threat from terrorism</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>On 23 October the U.S. Embassy in Turkey <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://tr.usembassy.gov/security-alert-u-s-mission-in-turkey/\">issued a warning to US citizens</a> of potential terrorist attacks and kidnappings against US citizens and foreign nationals in Istanbul, as well as potentially other locations in Turkey. Most terrorist attacks have taken place in the south-east of the country and in Ankara and Istanbul. While there is a potential that citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in the major cities, attacks are most likely to target the Turkish state, civilians and demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting public buildings, major events or large public gatherings. Be vigilant around significant religious occasions and public holidays; terrorist groups sometimes call for attacks around these times.</p>\n\n<p>Previous methods of attack have included armed assaults, suicide bombings, car bombings, rocket attacks, arson and improvised explosive devices left in refuse bins, crowded areas, shops and on public transport. Be vigilant, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>The Turkish authorities have successfully disrupted attack planning in the recent past and have said that security has been tightened in response to recent attacks.</p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened risk of terrorist attack against the aviation industry in Turkey.  You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey. Some organisations in the region though not proscribed in the UK, such as the YPG and the G\u00fclen Movement are illegal in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>A number of terrorist groups are active in Turkey:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"daesh\">Daesh</h3>\n<p>The last major attack attributed to Daesh occurred on 1 January 2017 at the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul; 39 people were killed and 69 injured. \nExtremist groups based in Syria including Daesh and Al-Qaeda (AQ) linked groups have the capacity to carry out attacks in neighbouring countries, including Turkey. Daesh has previously targeted border crossings and nearby locations on the Syrian side of the border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pkk\">PKK</h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a domestic terrorist presence in the south east of the country including in Van, Bitlis, Bingol, Elazig, Mus, Batman, Erzincan, Diyarbakir and Agri provinces.</p>\n\n<p>15 August is the anniversary of the first PKK attack against Turkish government installations. Historically, this anniversary date has prompted an escalation of violence by the PKK and other splinter groups.</p>\n\n<p>From the end of July 2015 there was an intensive period of violent incidents in Turkey\u2019s south-east and other provinces, although the pace of these has now decreased. The vast majority of these incidents have been PKK attacks on Turkish security forces, their premises and vehicles, with many members of the armed forces and police killed and injured. There have also been attacks on infrastructure (eg oil pipelines, dams) and incidents in which civilians have been affected. The government has responded with arrests of PKK suspects in Turkey and sustained military pressure on PKK positions in northern Iraq.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"far-left-groups--dhkp-c-and-thkp-c\">Far Left groups \u2013 DHKP-C and THKP-C</h3>\n<p>The anti-western, far left, proscribed terrorist group, THKP/C-Acilciler (Turkish People\u2019s Liberation Party/Front) and the linked DHKP/C (Revolutionary People\u2019s Liberation Front) remain active, and launched a series of attacks in Istanbul in 2015 targeting the Turkish police and judiciary. The DHKP/C attacks have mainly targeted the Turkish authorities and US diplomatic missions.</p>\n\n<p>Between approximately 30 March and 20 April, there are several dates significant to the DHKP/C, starting with the 30 March anniversary of their founding which may have been linked to previous attacks. 19 December is also recognised as an important date around which the DHKP/C may be active.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"global-threat\">Global threat</h2>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.  You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h2>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups operating in Syria, including Daesh and AQ-linked groups, routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. They\u2019re present in the Syrian border areas and you should be particularly vigilant if you are in these locations. Daesh and other terrorist groups view those engaged in humanitarian aid work or journalism as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>There remains an ongoing curfew for those who have a chronic medical condition.

Since July 2015 there has been an intensive period of PKK attacks on Turkish security forces, their premises and vehicles. Civilians have been affected. Security operations have taken place in the cities of Diyarbakir, Sirnak and Hakkari, with curfews imposed in these and other towns and cities in the region. If you\u2019re undertaking essential travel to these provinces, you should take extreme care.</p>\n\n<p>A temporary Turkish military restricted zone has been imposed for the Mount Ararat area. No permission is being given for parties to enter the area, nor to climb the mountain. Other temporary military restricted zones have been established in eastern provinces. Don\u2019t attempt to enter these zones. There may be some disruption to travel in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>The PKK have carried out attacks against Turkish security personnel and premises in Van province in August and September 2016. On 17 August 2016 an attack in central Van against a police station killed 3 people and injured 73 others.  On 4 September 2016, a mortar attack was launched against a police checkpoint in the Edremit district of Van Province, but there were no injuries. On 12 September 2016 an attack at a police checkpoint wounded at least 50 people in Van province. There have been subsequent clashes between Turkish security forces and the PKK resulting in a number of deaths and injuries. Take extra care if you\u2019re travelling to this area; keep up to date with local media and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>Sporadic demonstrations take place in cities across Turkey, some of which have, in the past, become violent. In Istanbul previous demonstrations have centered on the area around Taksim Square and on Istiklal Street. In Ankara, the protests have mainly taken place in the central Kizilay district around the Turkish Parliament. In Izmir the focus has been in the town centre, near the water front.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid all demonstrations and leave the area if one develops. Police have used tear gas and water cannon extensively to disperse protests. The effects of tear gas can be felt several hundred metres beyond the immediate site of demonstrations. Local transport routes may be disrupted.</p>\n\n<p>The situation in Turkey has calmed following an attempted coup on 15-16 July 2016. The security environment, however, remains potentially volatile.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Generally crime levels are low, but street robbery and pick-pocketing are common in the major tourist areas of Istanbul. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK. Alcohol and drugs can make you less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. If you are going to drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times so they are not spiked. Be wary of strangers approaching you offering food and drink (which may be drugged), to change money or to take you to a restaurant or nightclub.</p>\n\n<p>Passports have been stolen from rented villas, even when they have been kept in the villa safe. This is a particular problem in Didim, Kas, Kalkan and the Fethiye/Hisaronu/Ovacik areas.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, 30 cases of sexual assault, including rape, were reported to British consular staff in Turkey. Most of these cases occurred during the summer holiday period in coastal tourist areas. Many were committed late at night by someone the victim met during the evening. There have also been sexual attacks on minors visiting toilet facilities alone. You should be extra vigilant in these situations.</p>\n\n<p>Never accept lifts from strangers. Find a registered yellow taxi and make a note of the registration number before getting in.</p>\n\n<p>Very rarely counterfeit alcohol has been responsible for the death of some tourists. If you have any concerns, seek advice from your tour operator or the Turkish authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Take care when travelling by road throughout Turkey, particularly at night. Approach checkpoints slowly and follow the instructions of security personnel. Roads between the major cities are generally in excellent condition, but can be poor in remote, rural areas. Accidents are common and mainly due to poor or reckless driving.</p>\n\n<p>If you drive in Turkey, you must have either an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> or a notarised copy (in Turkish) of your UK driving licence. If you stay in Turkey continuously for more than 6 months, you must convert your UK driving licence into a Turkish licence. Provisional driving licences aren\u2019t recognised. If you intend to bring a vehicle registered in another country into Turkey you should familiarise yourself with the relevant Turkish customs regulations.</p>\n\n<p>You will need an \u2018A\u2019 category standard motorcycle licence to hire a motorcycle over 50cc in Turkey. An \u2018A1\u2019 category \u2018light motorcycle\u2019 driving licence is only suitable for motorcycles below 50cc. By law you must wear a helmet. Failure to do so could result in a heavy fine.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t drink and drive. The police will breathalyse drunk drivers, fine you on the spot and immediately confiscate your licence for 6 months.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>There is a heightened risk of terrorist attack against the aviation industry in Turkey. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports.

British nationals have been injured and in some cases killed participating in extreme sports.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stray-dogs\">Stray dogs</h3>\n<p>Most towns and cities have stray dogs. Local authorities take action to control and manage numbers but packs congregate in parks and wastelands and can be aggressive. Take care, remain calm, and avoid approaching stray dogs.

Most visits are trouble free. Be alert to your surroundings and remain vigilant in crowded places popular with foreign nationals, including during festival periods.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes, you are able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/entry-requirements#visas\">Visas</a></p>\n\n<p>Many parts of Turkey are subject to earthquakes. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow the advice of the local authorities. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>The situation has calmed following an attempted coup in July 2016. A state of emergency imposed after the coup attempt has been lifted, although some restrictions remain in place. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Turkey. Terrorist groups, including PKK, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and far left organisations, continue to plan and carry out attacks. Further attacks could be indiscriminate. Most attacks have taken place in the south-east of the country, and in Ankara and Istanbul. While there is a potential that citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in the major cities, attacks are most likely to target the Turkish state, civilians and demonstrations. You should be vigilant, follow the advice of local security authorities, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey, including expressions of support on social media. Some organisations in the region though not proscribed in the UK, such as the YPG and the G\u00fclen Movement are illegal in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>You should carry your passport and a printed copy of your visa (if applicable) or residence permit at all times. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the Turkish authorities are stopping members of the public to conduct ID checks. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a></p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay.

You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness.
