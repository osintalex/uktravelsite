However, the British Embassy has received increased reports of foreign nationals being targeted by groups of youths or scam artists. Petty theft and mugging is on the rise. There has been a smaller number of more serious incidents, including sexual harassment of women.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant if approached by strangers seeking assistance - criminal gangs are known to use distraction techniques including begging or feigning illness. Take particular care when visiting crowded public places, especially at night.</p>\n\n<p>Keep belongings on your person while travelling in taxis, and keep valuables like cameras and passports out of sight. Be aware of the risk of pickpocketing, bag and jewellery snatching including from vehicles stopped at traffic lights in Addis Ababa. Keep car doors locked whilst in your vehicle, and when parking leave your car in a well-lit and guarded area. Consider fitting anti-shatter film to all windows on your vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Large crowds are common on key national and religious dates. These include Ethiopian Christmas on 7 January, Epiphany/\u2019Timket\u2019 in January, Victory of Adawa on 2 March, Ethiopian Patriots\u2019 Victory Day on 5 May, Downfall of the Derg on 28 May, Ethiopian New Year on 11-12 September and The Finding of the True Cross/\u2019Meskel\u2019 in September. Large crowds also gather on Ethiopian (Orthodox) Easter; Eid Al Fitr; Eid Al Arafa and the Birthday of the Prophet Mohammed. Various parts of the country also have local festivals which can lead to large gatherings, often celebrating Saints days.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a small number of cases of arbitrary detention of British nationals in Ethiopia in recent years. There\u2019s a risk that this could reoccur \u2013 particularly where tensions are heightened (for example around major events, or in locations that might be deemed sensitive for security reasons). You should carry copies of your passport and the <a href=\"/world/organisations/british-embassy-addis-ababa\">contact details of the British Embassy Addis Ababa</a> at all times. This may help if you\u2019re questioned or detained. However, you should be aware that the Ethiopian authorities will not necessarily notify embassies when foreign nationals are detained. Even if requested, adequate consular access is not always granted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-and-safety\">Health and safety</h2>\n\n<p>Health and safety precautions like life jackets in boats or protective railings at historical sites are rarely in place in Ethiopia.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Driving standards and vehicle maintenance are often poor, and traffic accidents are a regular occurrence in Ethiopia, especially in Addis Ababa and on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti road. In Addis Ababa, British Embassy staff are advised to use only the metered yellow taxis as these generally have higher standards of maintenance than the blue and white taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Under Ethiopian law, drivers involved in car accidents can face severe punishments, including custodial sentences and fines. You should be very careful when travelling by car. If you\u2019re involved in a traffic accident you should remain in your vehicle and call the local police. You should avoid confrontation and await their arrival to resolve the matter.</p>\n\n<p>In the past some localised demonstrations have led to temporary closures of roads or the targeting of public transport. However, not all reports on social media channels of such disruptions are accurate. If you\u2019re unsure, you should contact local authorities or reputable tour operators in the areas you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>If you encounter a roadblock you should follow the advice of local authorities at the road block if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and don\u2019t attempt to pass it.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling outside Addis Ababa, you should avoid driving after dark in rural areas: vehicles often have no lights and livestock may be roaming on the roads. There have been instances where buses from one region have been attacked when passing through another.  Medical facilities outside the capital are extremely limited so carry a comprehensive medical pack. You should also consider communications \u2013 whilst mobile telephone services are increasingly widespread, connectivity cannot be guaranteed, and there have been multiple examples of mobile internet being closed down with no notice. You may wish to consider travelling in a party and leaving details of your travel itinerary with a reliable person.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>The Ethiopian authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ethiopia/coronavirus\">Coronavirus</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent incidences of civil unrest in Ethiopia, including protests and strikes. Some of these can cause temporary closure of roads or disruption to local business and transport, and in the past some have escalated into serious violence. Internet and mobile networks may be closed or disrupted during civil unrest. These incidents are often limited in duration and localised. Where they occur, the British Embassy will advise staff to reconsider any travel plans they have to the specified area and not to travel until the situation has calmed. This travel advice will flag incidents of concern, where British Embassy staff have received specific advice, but as unrest can occur with little or no notice you are also advised to monitor local news and reconsider travel plans to areas where disturbances are reported. If you\u2019re unsure, contact local authorities or reputable tour operators in the areas you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"addis-ababa\">Addis Ababa</h3>\n\n<p>Widespread protests took place in Addis Ababa following the death of singer Haacaaluu Hundeessaa on 29th June 2020. Further protests are possible.</p>\n\n<p>You should be alert to petty theft around Bole Addis Ababa International Airport, particularly pickpockets and bag snatches. When in or around the airport, keep valuables secure and out of sight. Only use buses or taxis from the airport that have been organised by your hotel or travel company, or choose yellow taxis rather than the blue and white ones.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in the level of reported crime against both expats and Ethiopian nationals in the Bole Medhanealem, Bole Atlas, Meskel Square and Yeka Hills areas of Addis Ababa. These have included robberies at knife point and the choking unconscious of victims by their attackers. Don\u2019t travel alone in these areas if possible. You should exercise caution if travelling on foot, and consider using road transportation where possible, both during the daytime and especially after dark. If threatened, hand over your valuables without resistance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"afar-region\">Afar Region</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel within 10km of the border with Eritrea, with the exception of the border crossing at Burre (Debay Sima).</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to visit the Danakil desert area, you should be aware of the risk of excessive heat and the difficult terrain in some areas, notably around the volcano of Erta Ale. Facilities are basic in Danakil; there is no running water and medical options are very limited.</p>\n\n<p>Tourism in the area has previously been targeted by armed groups in 2007, 2012 and 2017.

Though the situation has remained calm, you should familiarise yourself with the advice above about avoiding large gatherings, monitor local news and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>Violent clashes occurred in late September 2019 around Chilga Woreda, Central Gondar Zone, with reports of fatalities, including civilians. While attacks are mostly related to inter-ethnic disputes and foreigners have not been targeted, attacks can occur at any time with significant risk of being caught up in violence. If you\u2019re travelling in the area, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in roadblocks across Amhara Regional State recently. If you encounter a roadblock you should follow the advice of local authorities at the roadblock if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and don\u2019t attempt to pass it.</p>\n\n<p>Tensions exist along the Amhara-Tigray regional border, with occasional clashes including gunfire.

The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to Nekemte town in East Wollega. There have been repeated instances of violence in these areas including clashes between armed groups and security forces, violent crime and roadside attacks.</p>\n\n<p>There were widespread protests in parts of Oromia region following the death of singer Haacaaluu Hundeessaa on 29th June 2020. Areas in Shashemene, Ziway and Ambo were particularly affected. Some protests were violent with reported fatalities and damage to property. Further protests are possible. You may see an increased security presence across the region and experience continued internet and mobile phone disruption.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in roadblocks across Oromia Regional State recently. If you encounter a roadblock you should follow the advice of local authorities at the roadblock if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and don\u2019t attempt to pass it.</p>\n\n<p>Protests and demonstrations occur periodically in a range of towns across the Oromia region. These were at their height in 2016 but have continued more sporadically since that time. Towns in the Wellega and Shewa zones, and West Arsi zone, including Ambo, Wolissa, Nekemte and Shashemene, have been particularly affected. But demonstrations have also been witnessed elsewhere including in the Bale zone to the south-east. Some protests have turned violent and resulted in casualties; others caused severe disruption to road travel including major roads to and from Addis Ababa.</p>\n\n<p>In some instances international investors have been threatened, although the British Embassy is not aware of foreign tourists having been targeted.

The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to all other areas of the Somali Regional State, with the exception of the main road and railway to Djibouti through Fafan zone.</p>\n\n<p>There is local instability, lawlessness, military activity and a general risk of banditry in the Somali Region. Since the mid-1990s, insurgent groups, some affiliated with terrorist organisations, have clashed with government forces. Foreigners have been caught up in the violence or targeted.

Whilst such disturbances have been less frequent than in several other areas of Ethiopia, a number have turned violent at short notice. You should familiarise yourself with the advice above about avoiding large gatherings, and should follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>Some tensions remain in parts of Southern Nations Region following the announcement of the creation of a Sidama Region.

If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers.

If dealing with official documents, you can expect the date to be written in the Ethiopian calendar.</p>\n\n<p>Time of day is also counted differently by traditional Ethiopian mechanisms. Daytime hours are counted beginning from what would be 0600 using a globally standard 24-hour clock, and nightime hours from 1800. \u201c2am\u201d on the Ethiopian clock is therefore equivalent to 0800.

However, many believers are devout in their respective faiths and you should make sure to respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious sites of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Outside Addis Ababa, particularly in rural areas, women may wish to dress modestly to avoid the possibility of causing offence. Modest dress is a must when visiting religious sites.</p>\n\n<p>Ethiopian Orthodox Christians fast each Wednesday, Friday and in several other periods. In predominantly Orthodox areas, at these times only vegan dishes are likely to be available except in larger hotels and restaurants catering to foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexual acts (applying to both sexes) are illegal, and carry penalties of between 1 and 15 years imprisonment.

After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked \u201ctransit shuttle bus\u201d from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers transiting Addis Ababa Bole International Airport are subject to COVID-19 screening measures during transit. See below.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"screening-on-arrival\">Screening on arrival</h3>\n\n<p>Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international airports) have put in place measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Arriving passengers are required to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate prior to entry. Additional screening may include temperature measurements, completing a health screening questionnaire and answering questions from health officials. This will include checks on recent travel to affected areas and your accommodation details for your self-isolation (see Quarantine requirements below).</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and  will be tested. Any person that tests positive for COVID-19 will be prohibited from entering Ethiopia.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quarantine-requirements\">Quarantine requirements</h3>\n\n<p>All passengers arriving into the country (except diplomats) are required to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate, dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) . Only RT 2PCR tests will be accepted. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight.</p>\n\n<p>All passengers will be subject to 7 days mandatory self-isolation. You must provide the address for your self-isolation upon arrival.</p>\n\n<p>Diplomats are encouraged to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate. Where they do so, they will need to self-isolate at their residence for 7 days. Where they do not present a negative test certificate, they will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"land-border-quarantine\">Land border quarantine</h3>\n\n<p>Measures are in place when arriving into the country across land borders.</p>\n\n<p>Those crossing with a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) will be screened for symptoms and required to self-isolate at home for 7 days. Those that do not present a negative test certificate will be screened and required to self-isolate for 14 days. Only PCR tests will be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and a further test. The standard of isolation centres varies significantly around the country.</p>\n\n<p>You should check for the latest information with local authorities before travelling to the border.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"regular-entry-requirements\">Regular entry requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n<p>You will need a visa to enter Ethiopia.</p>\n\n<p>E-visas can be purchased in advance from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.evisa.gov.et/\">Ethiopian E-Visa website</a>.
