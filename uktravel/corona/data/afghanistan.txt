The advice from the Afghan Ministry of Public Health is that if you are displaying symptoms, call 166 and they will guide you on what to do next.

You should monitor media reporting and make sure you have robust contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, keep others informed of your travel plans and vary your routes and routines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>Afghanistan is undergoing a major transition in terms of politics, economy and security, including the potential start of peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban A presidential election took place on 28 September 2019. Final results were declared on 18 February 2020 and a power sharing agreement between President Ghani and Dr Abdullah was agreed in May 2020. The risk for violence around political events and rallies remains. You should avoid all political demonstrations and public gatherings. Keep up to date with developments in the security situation, including through monitoring local media.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Road travel is highly dangerous. Insurgents have set up false vehicle checkpoints from which violent attacks have been launched, and there continue to be fatal roadside bombings and attacks on military and civilian vehicles. In addition to the threat from terrorism and kidnapping, there is also a continuing criminal threat from carjacking and robbery. Avoid travelling between cities at night.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport is dangerous. Taxis and long distance buses are often poorly maintained, uninsured and driven by unqualified drivers. Privately hired transport is often driven by uninsured, unqualified drivers. You should carry out long distance journeys by air where possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel by road you should only travel in secure transport with close protection, using reputable local drivers and guides. Make sure doors are locked and windows closed. You should consider strongly the use of armoured vehicles. Most road surfaces are in a very poor condition. The overall standard of driving is poor and most local drivers are uninsured. Accidents may lead to confrontation and threatening behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Afghanistan with a valid driving licence for up to one year.  If you\u2019re staying longer in Afghanistan you will need to get a local licence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"non-governmental-organisations-ngos\">Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)</h3>\n<p>There have been a number of serious attacks on both western and Afghan NGOs and vehicles belonging to them, in which people have been killed or injured. NGO workers have been kidnapped near their places of work. Most attacks continue to occur in the east and south of Afghanistan with a recent increase in activity in the central areas. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ngosafety.org\">International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO)</a> issues regular security updates for NGOs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>All airlines from Afghanistan have been refused permission to operate services to the EU because Afghanistan is unable to ensure that its airlines meet international safety standards. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> staff are advised to use carriers which aren\u2019t subject to the EU operating ban.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transiting-uae\">Transiting UAE</h3>\n<p>Flying to Dubai and then transferring is the most common route into Afghanistan. If you are planning to travel this route, you should also check <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates\">travel advice for the United Arab Emirates</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to transit the United Arab Emirates carrying unlicensed personal protection equipment. This includes, but is not limited to, body armour (including ballistic vests), weapon holsters and handcuffs. Other specialist technical equipment such as satellite phones, listening and recording devices, powerful cameras and binoculars, while freely available in the UK, may also require licences. Persons found carrying any such items without a licence may be subject to conviction resulting in imprisonment and substantial monetary fines in accordance with Emirati law.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Crime is a serious concern, particularly in rural areas. Foreigners have been the victims of violent attacks, including armed robbery and rape. Don\u2019t display any obvious signs of wealth, or carry large sums of money. Don\u2019t travel alone, especially on foot. Take particular care after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Harassment of foreign women is not unusual including uninvited physical contact and unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"advice-to-business\">Advice to business</h3>\n\n<p>Specific guidance for companies seeking to do business in Afghanistan can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exporting-to-afghanistan\">Department for International Trade (DIT)</a> website. DIT are also able to put you in touch with companies operating in Afghanistan who offer security services.

The British Embassy in Kabul operates under strict security protocols and always uses armoured vehicles; staff receive regular security briefings to enable them to carry out their work in as safe an environment as possible. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Only travel with reputable local guides and to fully protected workplaces. Take the greatest possible care and vary your routines. Don\u2019t publicise your travel, including on social media. If possible, maintain radio or telephone communications to report your movements. Avoid any protests, demonstrations or large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>There are large amounts of unexploded bombs and land mines (both anti-tank and anti-personnel) throughout the country.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">global threat from terrorism</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Multiple threats are issued daily. Terrorists and insurgents conduct frequent and widespread lethal attacks against Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF), domestic and international political and civilian targets including within the city gates, and those working in the security, humanitarian and reconstruction fields. You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in Kabul, including from high-profile, large-scale attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Past incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In May 2020 two IED attacks targeted Imams inside their mosques in Kabul city, killing at least six people and wounding more than 20 others.</li>\n  <li>on 12 May 2020, a terrorist attack targeted a maternity ward at a hospital in Kabul city, killing 24 and wounding at least another 20 people.</li>\n  <li>on 25 March 2020, a terrorist attack targeted a Sikh Gurdwara in Kabul city, killing 25 and wounding at least another eight people.</li>\n  <li>on 6 March 2020, a terrorist attack targeted a Shi\u2019a memorial in Kabul city, killing 32 and wounding at least another 60 people.</li>\n  <li>on 18 October 2019, a suicide bomber targeted a mosque in Deh Bala, Nagarhar, killing 69 and wounding 36</li>\n  <li>on 18 August 2019, a suicide bomber struck at a Shia wedding ceremony in the west of Kabul, killing 63 people and wounding more than 180 others</li>\n  <li>on 7 August 2019, a suicide vehicle based device struck a police location in Kabul city, killing 14 and injuring 145, 92 of whom were civilians</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The insurgency has a strong anti-Western focus; this could make any UK interest or person a target. Attacks include bombs (roadside and other), suicide bombs (either on foot or by vehicle), indirect fire (rockets and mortars), direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades), kidnappings and violent crime. Daesh is also fiercely hostile to the UK and other western countries.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide to travel to Afghanistan, you should read this section in conjunction with the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/safety-and-security\">Safety and Security section</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should be particularly vigilant on public or religious holidays, in and around landmark locations and places where large public crowds can gather. Hotels used by the government of Afghanistan and western nationals, ministries, military establishments, airports (including Kabul International) and religious sites have been attacked and further attacks are possible. Installations and life support facilities have been subject to attacks in recent years, specifically for their link to Western countries. Avoid regular visits to public places frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants, shops and market places, especially at times of day when they are particularly busy and congested.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy does not allow official visitors to stay in any hotel overnight, and has placed restaurants off limits to staff. Make sure your accommodation is secure, and review your security measures regularly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n\n<p>The risk of being kidnapped throughout Afghanistan remains a very high and constant threat. At least four foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Kabul since July 2016, some of whom remain in captivity:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in January 2020, an international commercial contractor was kidnapped in Kabul or in a nearby province: the victim remains missing.</li>\n  <li>on 2 August 2018, 3 international workers were killed shortly after kidnap in Kabul</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Over 100 westerners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan since 2001, a number of them have been British nationals. The motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. You should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice while in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid and some other development work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"regions\">Regions</h2>\n\n<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>) advise against all or all but essential travel to different parts of the country according to provincial region:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kabul\">Kabul</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to Kabul\u2019s Enhanced Security Zone and Hamid Karzai International Airport, and against all travel to all other areas within the city of Kabul.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in the capital. There\u2019s an ongoing threat from high-profile, large-scale attacks.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling in Kabul, take particular care on Airport road, Jalalabad road and Darulaman road. Avoid travelling on Jalalabad and Darulaman roads during commuter or other busy times (around 6am to 8am, 9am to 11am and 3pm to 4pm local time), when traffic can be heaviest and the risk of an attack against government and western people or interests is most likely. Avoid travelling along Airport road except for essential movements as attacks are likely throughout the day.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-afghanistan\">Northern Afghanistan</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to Faryab, Jowzjan, Baghlan, Takhar, Kunduz, Badakhshan, Sar-e-pul, Balkh and Samangan provinces.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been a number of attacks against aid workers and military vehicles resulting in deaths and injuries, and there are ongoing military operations throughout the north. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice against all travel to Badakhshan includes travel to or climbing and trekking within the Wakhan Corridor.</p>\n\n<p>On 8 February 2017, six Afghan staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were shot and killed in Jowzjan Province, Afghanistan. Two further staff members travelling in the same convoy are so far unaccounted for.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"eastern-afghanistan\">Eastern Afghanistan</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to Ghazni, Kapisa, Khost, Kunar, Laghman, Logar, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Paktika, Wardak, Paktya and Parvan provinces, and Bamian province (except the capital, Bamian city).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to the city of Bamian and the province of Panjshir.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The eastern region has been extremely volatile for some time, with almost daily suicide and roadside bomb attacks, shootings and rocket attacks. The region close to the Pakistani border is extremely dangerous with a high number of insurgents operating freely. On 27 July 2019, a Vehicle Borne Explosive Device (VBED) struck a police headquarters in Ghazni province, killing 4 and injuring 30. Insurgents continue to fight each other in Nangarhar province while maintaining a steady stream of attacks against governmental and security forces, often causing civilian casualties.</p>\n\n<p>On 7 July 2019 a VBED targeted the headquarters of the Afghan National Security Directorate in Ghazni city, killing 12 and injuring 179, mainly schoolchildren.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular, large military operations in this region. There have been numerous daily attacks against Afghan and non-Afghan forces. There are also daily incidents of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), suicide and rocket attacks, and direct fire attacks on security forces patrols, checkpoints and bases as well as on the local population.</p>\n\n<p>On 21 January 2019, insurgents attacked a military compound in Maidan Shar, with an estimated death toll of over 100.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"southern-afghanistan\">Southern Afghanistan</h3>\n\n<p>\u2022 the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to Helmand, Kandahar, Nimroz, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces</p>\n\n<p>On 18 July 2019, a truck filled with explosives detonated at the Afghan Police Headquarters in Kandahar city before attackers entered the compound.

See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since 19 March non-core British Embassy staff in Kabul, have been withdrawn from Post. Core staff remain to continue operational work.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is not available in parts of Afghanistan where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel and severely limited where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel. The level of consular assistance the British Embassy can provide to travellers in Afghanistan is extremely limited. There are limits to the assistance the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can provide in a crisis, depending on the security and transport situation. You should not assume that the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> will be able to provide assistance to leave the country.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy is not able to accept registrations from British nationals travelling in Afghanistan or monitor their safety when they are in country. Staff from the British Embassy may be unable to travel to certain parts of the country due to the security situation; this may severely limit the consular assistance that can be offered. Travel by road throughout the country, but particularly outside the capital Kabul, is extremely dangerous. Seek professional security advice for all travel and consider using armoured vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Hotels and guesthouses used by foreign nationals and the government of Afghanistan are subject to regular threats. The British Embassy doesn\u2019t allow official visitors to stay in hotels overnight and has placed restaurants and other venues off limits to staff. Make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. Specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication. You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in Kabul. Follow the instructions of local authorities. There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Afghanistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from powerful earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. The British Embassy can provide limited consular assistance in Afghanistan, particularly outside the capital Kabul. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>You can contact the emergency services by calling 119 (police and ambulance) and 112 (fire).  They are unlikely to speak English.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.</p>\n\n", "document": {"id": "e4b4e753-79b2-4cb2-8cfa-d6c53b530ff2", "url": "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5f4e0c62d3bf7f0a2769e197/FCDO__TA__001_-_Afghanistan_Travel_Advice_Ed1.pdf", "content_type": "application/pdf", "attachment_type": "file"}, "updated_at": "2020-09-08T15:50:44Z", "reviewed_at": "2020-08-04T14:38:32Z", "alert_status": [], "max_cache_time": 10, "email_signup_link": "/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/email-signup", "change_description": "Update to information on COVID-19 negative certificate requirements, the current political situation and terrorism and kidnapping incidents ('Coronavirus', 'Safety and security' and 'Terrorism' pages)", "change_history": [{"note": "Latest update: Summary and Terrorism section - on 20 November 2018, a suicide attack on a wedding hall in Kabul killed approximately 55 people and injured over 85;
