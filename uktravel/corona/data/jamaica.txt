Gang violence and shootings are common, although usually confined to inner city neighbourhoods. Be especially cautious if you\u2019re travelling to West Kingston, Grant\u2019s Pen, August Town, Harbour View, Spanish Town and certain parts of Montego Bay, including Flankers, Barrett Town, Norwood, Glendevon, Rose Heights and Mount Salem.</p>\n\n<p>The motive for most attacks on tourists is robbery. There are mobile police patrols, but you should take steps to protect yourself and your belongings. Be vigilant at all times, even if you\u2019re staying with friends and family. Don\u2019t walk alone in isolated areas or on deserted beaches, even during the day. Take particular care when withdrawing money from ATMs. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash or wear eye-catching jewellery. Try to vary which restaurants you use. Using the same place too often might make you a target for thieves. Avoid using buses at night.</p>\n\n<p>Most hotels and resorts are well guarded, but robberies can occur. Follow hotel security procedures. Use hotel safe, lock windows and doors and report suspicious activity. If you are in residential accommodation, make sure proper door locks and window grilles are fitted and consider employing a guard and fitting a house alarm. Gated and guarded compounds are normally the safest type of accommodation.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals and those returning to resettle permanently in Jamaica. Before returning to resettle, seek advice from the Jamaican High Commission in London and the local Jamaican Information Service. The Jamaican Constabulary Force have produced a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://issuu.com/jamaicaconstabularyforce2015/docs/returning_residents_booklet_-__dece\">safety and security guide</a> for returning citizens.</p>\n\n<p>There have been some violent incidents, including armed robbery, murder and rape. There is also a risk of sexual assault against tourists. You should maintain at least the same level of personal safety awareness as you would at home, including at popular events. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">guidance for women travelling abroad</a> that may be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t resist in the event of an attempted robbery. If you need the police in an emergency, call 119.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-operations\">Security operations</h3>\n<p>As part of security enhancement measures, the Government of Jamaica is taking action in areas of concern.</p>\n\n<p>The government has put in place a number of Zones of Special Operations (ZOSOs). These are currently active in parts of Kingston and Montego Bay. These measures allow the military to support the police in joint security operations in response to recent violence and shooting incidents.</p>\n\n<p>Security operations are ongoing and further activity including curfews could occur with little or no notice. You should exercise caution if you\u2019re affected areas, particularly if travelling at night, and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any restrictions. These may also result in road closures or travel delays, and the operating hours of some businesses may be subject to change.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"demonstrations\">Demonstrations</h2>\n<p>Public order incidents and demonstrations can occur across Jamaica, and may cause significant disruption to traffic and public transportation. You should avoid all demonstrations; they have the potential to turn violent and are often used by criminals as cover for robbery and theft.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>The Jamaican police may impose curfews at short notice for specific towns or areas.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-to-and-from-norman-manley-international-airport\">Travel to and from Norman Manley International Airport</h3>\n<p>There have been outbreaks of violence in recent years in the Mountain View area on the route between Kingston and Norman Manley International Airport. Therefore, you should avoid the Mountain View Avenue route and use the alternative signposted Humming Bird route via South Camp Road instead.</p>\n\n<p>The British High Commission has previously received reports of British nationals being robbed when travelling to private accommodation from Norman Manley International Airport. Be especially vigilant when travelling from the airport to your accommodation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>Travellers can expect delays and cancellation of flights in and out of Jamaica at short notice. These can be as a result of COVID19  measures, poor weather conditions or operational problems.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive in Jamaica using a UK driving licence for up to 6 months. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Kingston, don\u2019t drive in the city. If you get lost, you risk putting yourself and your passengers in personal danger. Some hire cars and minibuses don\u2019t have seatbelts fitted in the rear. Check with the hire car company before you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Road accidents and fatalities are common. Many roads are badly maintained with poor signage. Roads in rural areas are narrow, winding and poorly lit at night. Speeding and drink-driving are common.</p>\n\n<p>Drive defensively, and take great care on the roads, whether you are in a vehicle or a pedestrian. Drivers and front seat passengers must wear seat belts at all times. Keep the windows up and doors locked. Be particularly vigilant when stopping at junctions or traffic lights. Criminals are known to use techniques which distract drivers to gain access to vehicles to steal handbags and other items of value.</p>\n\n<p>Motorcycle riders must wear a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Hurricanes, tropical storms and road-works can temporarily block roads. Check your route in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Only use Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB) approved taxis or minibuses for excursions, airport transfers and sightseeing. Don\u2019t hail a taxi in the street and don\u2019t share a taxi with strangers. Most hotels and resorts have assigned JTB drivers who carry photo ID and display a prominent blue JTB sticker on the front windscreen.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in Jamaica, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

In Jamaica, certain same-sex sexual activity is illegal. In practice these laws are rarely enforced. However, the attitude of many Jamaicans to the LGBT community is hostile. LGBT travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that public displays of affection may attract unwanted and negative attention. Public displays of affection (such as hand-holding or kissing) between opposite or same-sex couples are uncommon.
