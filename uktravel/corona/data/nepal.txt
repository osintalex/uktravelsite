Contact the Nepali Central Child Welfare Board for confirmation before signing up to volunteer for one of these organisations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a low rate of serious crime in Nepal. However, you should take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>Watch out for pick-pockets and bag-snatching, particularly in airports, on buses and in areas popular with foreign nationals like Thamel, Sanepa and Kupondol in Kathmandu.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when walking around at night.

Keep valuables in a hotel safe if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual assaults against foreign nationals, particularly women, have been reported in tourist areas, including Thamel and Sanepa in Kathmandu. Be wary of accepting drinks from strangers, don\u2019t leave drinks unattended and exercise caution, especially when alone after dark.

The Government currently plans to allow long-route, medium and short distance public transportation from 21 September, and travel between different districts will no longer require the prior approval of the Chief District Officer(s) concerned.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are poor, especially during the monsoon season or in mountain areas. The 2015 earthquakes affected many roads and reconstruction work is still ongoing, making conditions worse.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling during monsoon season, see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nepal/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>Bus accidents are common in Nepal and there are a number of accidents resulting in fatalities every year. Buses are often overcrowded, poorly regulated, poorly maintained, and driving standards are low. Avoid travel on overnight buses. Don\u2019t travel on overloaded or overcrowded buses. Tourist buses usually offer a higher standard of comfort and safety.</p>\n\n<p>General driving standards are poor. Many drivers are not properly licensed, trained or insured and vehicles, including taxis, are often poorly maintained. There are few pavements outside central Kathmandu and motorists don\u2019t yield right of way to pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>Other road users often ignore motorbikes and bicycles.  It\u2019s the law to wear a helmet when riding a motorbike. You should also wear a suitable helmet when riding as a passenger, and when riding a bicycle.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Nepal, an <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> is recommended. UK driving licence holders are not eligible to drive in Nepal without a Nepali driving licence or an IDP. There is no time limit for the use of IDPs in Nepal. You can get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Carry your IDP with you at all times as well as any vehicle registration documents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>The Government of Nepal\u2019s suspension of commercial international flights was lifted on 1 September. At present, Nepalis, and some groups of people from defined employment categories, and their dependants, will be permitted to travel on commercial flights.

Bad weather conditions in mountainous and hill regions could further increase the risk to your safety and cause lengthy delays.

If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the FCDO assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Two improvised explosive devices detonated in Kathmandu in February and March 2019, causing injuries and one fatality.
