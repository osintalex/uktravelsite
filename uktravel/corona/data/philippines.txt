The National Capital Region (Metro Manila), Bacolod, Batangas, Iloilo City and Tacloban are subject to General Community Quarantine (GCQ) measures. The rest of the Philippines is under Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ). However, changes can be made at short notice so you should monitor the status in your local area.</p>\n\n<p>Non-essential travel, including for tourist purposes, is now permitted between GCQ and MGCQ regions. There may be entry requirements imposed from region to region so you should check with the relevant local authority.</p>\n\n<p>Metro Manila is currently subject to a curfew from midnight-4am with the exception of Navotas City which has curfew hours of 8pm-4am.</p>\n\n<p>Some cities are imposing age restrictions on people permitted to leave their residence for non-essential reasons. These vary by region so you should familiarise yourself with the requirements in your local area.</p>\n\n<p>The wearing of face shields while on public transport is now mandatory. This includes but is not limited to trains, buses, jeepneys, taxis, boats and ships. The order also includes aeroplanes. You should check with your airline in advance whether they will provide a shield or whether you need to bring your own.</p>\n\n<p>You should closely monitor announcements from local authorities to understand the latest restrictions and regulations where you are situated, and their impact on your ability to travel and access essential services. Check the requirements of your local authority such as barangay clearance, health certificate or travel authority for any travel outside of your residence, including to the airport.

Attacks have been carried out using small arms and improvised explosive devices, including both vehicle and personnel borne.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist activity continues to pose a threat from groups such as the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), New People\u2019s Army (NPA and other associated groups. Some groups have pledged allegiance to Daesh (formally referred to as ISIL) and are likely to regard westerners as legitimate targets.</p>\n\n<p>Recent notable incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 24 August 2020, dual explosions in Jolo, Sulu resulting in a number of deaths and injuries</li>\n  <li>on 28 June 2019, a dual suicide attack on a military base in Indanan in Sulu Province killed 3 civilians and 3 military personnel as well as the 2 attackers.

Incidents in July 2019 resulted in at least 15 deaths in Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental. Previous clashes have resulted in bystanders being injured. Before travelling to rural areas, you should research the area thoroughly.</p>\n\n<p>There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnap in the Philippines. Foreign nationals have been targeted by both criminal and terrorist groups.</p>\n\n<p>This threat extends throughout the Philippines, and foreigners have been targeted in rural, urban and coastal areas, on private boats, marinas and resorts. The threat of kidnapping isn\u2019t confined to terrorist strongholds and kidnaps may be opportunistic. Kidnap groups have sought to expand their reach including by working with affiliates to abduct foreign nationals from one area of the Philippines before transporting the victims to another.</p>\n\n<p>The threat is particularly acute in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago and offshore areas in the nearby waters of the Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea. A British national and a dual Filipino-British national were kidnapped on 4 October 2019 from a resort in Zamboanga, Western Mindanao. They were successfully rescued on 25 November 2019 by the Philippines Armed Forces. However, some hostages, including foreign nationals, have been murdered. A Dutch national was killed on 31 May 2019 after being held for 7 years. It\u2019s likely that terrorist groups continue to plan kidnap operations against western nationals.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial shipping companies have been advised to adopt heightened vigilance when navigating the Sulu and Celebes Seas. The Regional Co-operation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.recaap.org/\">(ReCAAP)</a>  advise all ships to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.recaap.org/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&amp;EntryId=463&amp;PortalId=0&amp;TabId=78\">re-route from the area</a> where possible. Most maritime incidents occur in the Sulu Sea in the area between Mindanao, the Sulu archipelago, Palawan and Sabah (Malaysia). Boats travelling to and from offshore islands and dive sites are possible targets, and terrorist groups have threatened to attack passenger ferries and other vessels, particularly those operating from Mindanao.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>You must be able to show some identification if requested by the police.

If you\u2019re in Davao Del Sur, or are planning to travel to the area, you should be careful of aftershocks, monitor local media for up-to-date information and follow the advice of local authorities. You should check with transportation companies for any changes or cancellations of schedule.</p>\n\n<p>On 22 April 2019, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck north eastern Luzon and was felt strongly in Metro Manila.

Sudden steam and ash explosions may occur at any time. . Check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to volcanic areas. Avoid volcanic areas during and immediately after heavy rainfall when there\u2019s increased risk of lava flows. You can find more information about volcanoes on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/\">Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The lake Taal volcano 60km south of Manila has been experiencing increased volcanic activity since 12 January 2020. On 14 February the Philippines\u2019 authorities reduced the alert level from 3 down to 2. This should not be interpreted that unrest has ceased, or that the threat of a hazardous eruption has disappeared. The volcano is under constant monitoring by Philippine authorities and the alert level will be raised again if an increase in activity is detected. You should follow updates on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/index.php/taal-volcano-bulletin-menu/\">PhiVolcs official website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The eruptive activity of the Mayon volcano in Albay Province (Bicol region) has reduced since 2018, although it remains at a moderate level of unrest with a risk of sudden eruptions, lava collapses and ash fall. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has lowered the alert to level 2 but an exclusion zone remains in place. If you\u2019re in Albay Province, you should follow the advice of the local authorities, including the advice not to enter the designated danger zone. You should remain vigilant and follow developments on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/\">PHIVOLCS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Ash plumes can affect air quality and have an impact on health.

Terrorist groups have the intent and capability to carry out attacks anywhere in the country, including in the capital Manila and in places visited by foreigners, such as airports, shopping malls, public transport, including the metro system, and places of worship. You should remain vigilant at all times and report anything suspicious to the local authorities. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/philippines/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s likely that terrorist groups continue to plan kidnap operations against western nationals in the Philippines, both on land and at sea.

The judicial system can result in long-term detention until a court hearing takes place. Detention facilities are far below UK standards. Don\u2019t become involved with drugs of any kind.
