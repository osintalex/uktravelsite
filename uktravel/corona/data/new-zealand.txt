Thefts from unattended vehicles, especially hire cars and camper vans in major tourist areas (the Coromandel Peninsula, Rotorua and Queenstown) have increased. There has also been an increase in the number of thefts from hotel rooms in some tourist areas. Don\u2019t leave possessions in unattended vehicles even if out of sight in a locked boot.

If you are taking part in extreme sports check that the company is well established in the industry and that your insurance covers you. If you are visiting remote areas, check with local tourist authorities for advice before setting out. Make sure you register your details with a visitor information centre or leave details with family or friends. Weather conditions can quickly become treacherous in some areas.

Even the main highways can be narrow, winding and hilly. Read a copy of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/roadcode/\">Road Code</a> - the official guide to traffic rules and traffic safety - before driving.

Accident victims don\u2019t have a legal right to sue a third party in the event of an accident in New Zealand. Instead the Accident Compensation Commission (ACC) helps pay for your care if you\u2019re injured as a result of an accident. However, the ACC only covers the cost of treatment in New Zealand and delayed travel or loss of income in a third country isn\u2019t covered. You should therefore make sure you have adequate travel and accident insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The November 2016 earthquake caused significant damage to roads and rail in the Canterbury region between Christchurch and Picton, making some areas inaccessible.
