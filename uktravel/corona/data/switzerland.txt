Do not leave your valuables unattended.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/travel-safely-travel-aware\">This leaflet</a>,  produced by the British Embassy and the Swiss transport police, gives more advice on what to do if you\u2019re pickpocketed, including useful contacts.

Traffic regulations are strictly enforced. Any serious breach of the regulations can result in heavy fines and/or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>A reflective jacket and a warning triangle are compulsory and must be kept within easy reach (not in the boot). You must also have a first aid kit in the car. Radar detectors are prohibited in Switzerland (whether in use or not). The limit for alcohol in the bloodstream is 0.05% and police may request any driver to undergo a breath test or drugs test.</p>\n\n<p>The speed limit on Swiss motorways is 120km/h unless otherwise indicated. Serious traffic offences (including <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ch.ch/en/driving-over-speed-limit/\">driving over the speed limit</a>) can lead to criminal prosecution. You may face detention while awaiting trial. There is no standard penalty because sentencing varies from canton to canton.</p>\n\n<p>If you receive a traffic fine while driving in Switzerland you might be asked to pay on the spot. If you wish to challenge the fine, you can appeal in writing to the competent Swiss authority by the deadline, giving your reasons and presenting documentary proof. Fines can be enforced for a period of 3 years. This is to encourage foreign motorists who wish to re-enter Switzerland to pay their fine. Unpaid fines can result in a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorways\">Motorways</h3>\n<p>You must purchase and display a vignette (sticker) to travel on Swiss motorways or face large fines. You can buy a vignette at most border crossings, petrol stations, post offices, by phone (+800 1002 0030) and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ch.ch/en/swiss-motorway-sticker/\">online</a>. The price of a vignette is currently CHF 40.</p>\n\n<p>Motorway journeys are usually trouble-free, but if you\u00b4re involved in a car accident, use the orange emergency phones to ask for help.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-conditions\">Road conditions</h3>\n<p>Many roads outside of urban areas are narrow and winding, and road conditions can deteriorate fast (even in summer) especially during heavy rainfall and subsequent snowfall at higher altitudes. You should reduce your speed significantly to suit the conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Alpine winters often make driving more difficult. You should equip your car with winter tyres and snow-chains, and check road conditions prior to departure. You should carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>You can find the latest information on road conditions on the websites of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.tcs.ch/de/tools/verkehrsinfo-verkehrslage/aktuelle-lage.php\">Swiss Touring Club (in German, French and Italian)</a>.

Unfortunately each year there are incidents with visitors getting into difficulty and needing the help of the emergency services. There have been a number of tragic accidents involving British visitors, including during extreme sports activities.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re taking part in extreme sports, check that the company is well established in the industry and that you\u2019ve arranged for your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel insurance</a> to cover the specific activity. For sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (e.g. off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding or BASE jumping), your insurance should include mountain rescue services, helicopter costs and repatriation to your country of residence or possible transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you\u2019re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario. A map, compass, GPS and telecommunication equipment should always be used when travelling outside urban areas. Don\u2019t undertake any activity alone, and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.</p>\n\n<p>The following alpine hazards exist throughout the year:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avalanches and snow drifts</li>\n  <li>landslides and flooding</li>\n  <li>glacial crevasses and hollows</li>\n  <li>rock fall</li>\n  <li>thunder storms and lightning</li>\n  <li>altitude sickness</li>\n  <li>sun exposure</li>\n  <li>sudden weather changes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To check the latest avalanche risk, visit the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home.html?tab=alarm\">Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology</a>. Observe all warnings about avalanches and where appropriate consider carrying search equipment. Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. You should carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. You should follow all safety instructions carefully given the danger of avalanches in some areas and particularly during times of heavy snow. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used provide the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim.</p>\n\n<p>For more information and advice on enjoying outdoor activities safely and responsibly, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/home.html\">official website of Switzerland Tourism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about how to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes\">stay safe on the slopes</a>.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorist attacks in Switzerland can\u2019t be ruled out.
