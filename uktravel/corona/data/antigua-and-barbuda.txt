This also applies if you are staying on a yacht. Be vigilant at all times. Take care when walking alone off the busy main roads and avoid isolated areas, including beaches, particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Only use licensed taxis and take particular care at late night street parties, especially during the festival season.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery.

You should check that the hotel safe is securely fixed before using it to store your items.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Driving is on the left. To drive in the country you must get a local temporary driving licence. Car hire companies will usually help with this process.

You should take extra care on minor roads and in rural areas where there are narrow roads and blind corners. Pedestrians often walk on the roads and indicators are not always used.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving at night as some roads are unlit. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t stop if you\u2019re flagged down by pedestrians. Keep car doors locked when driving.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of an accident, call the police and don\u2019t move the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis aren\u2019t metered. Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations. Agree the fare in local currency with the driver before you set off. You can often pay in US dollars as well as EC dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport is available and cheaper. Minibus drivers might drive above the speed limit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h3>\n\n<p>Beaches in Antigua and Barbuda are open between 05:00 and 19:00 daily. During these hours, picnics, music, drinking alcohol, and parties are prohibited. People visiting the beach must wear masks covering their noses and mouths, and maintain a distance of six feet from other people.</p>\n\n<p>Take great care at all times when swimming as currents can be deceptively strong and not all beaches have lifeguards and/or warning flags.
