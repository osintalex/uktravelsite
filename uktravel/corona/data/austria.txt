Safeguard your valuables against pick-pockets, especially in the major cities when tourists can be targeted for passports and money. If you\u2019re travelling on international trains to or from Austria you should be especially aware of your luggage.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n<p>Hiking, mountaineering and other adventure sports are popular activities in Austria. Unfortunately, each year there are incidents with visitors getting into difficulty and needing the help of the emergency services.</p>\n\n<p>If you are taking part in extreme sports, check that the company is well established in the industry and that you\u2019ve arranged for your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">insurance</a> to cover this specific activity. For sporting activities such as skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (e.g. off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding or BASE jumping), your insurance should include mountain rescue services, helicopter costs and repatriation to your country of residence or possible transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you\u2019re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario. A map, compass, GPS and telecommunication equipment should always be used when travelling outside urban areas. Don\u2019t undertake any activity alone, and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"skiing\">Skiing</h2>\n<p>If you are planning a skiing holiday, for advice on weather and safety conditions before you travel contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.austria.info/uk\">Austrian Tourist Agency</a> by email: <a href=\"mailto:info@austria.info\">info@austria.info</a> or telephone 00800 400 200 00. Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. You should follow all safety instructions carefully given the danger of avalanches in some areas and in particular in times of heavy snow. Always check with the local tourist offices on current snow and weather conditions on arrival. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used provide the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim. You can get information about the risk of an avalanche occurring by email: <a href=\"mailto:lawine@tirol.gv.at\">lawine@tirol.gv.at</a> or by visiting the websites of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.lawine.at/\">Tirol Avalanche Warning Service</a> or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.avalanches.org/\">European Avalanche Warning Service</a>. Take extra care during the spring season, as this is when avalanches most commonly occur.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about how to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes\">stay safe on the slopes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>In 2019 there were 416 road deaths in Austria (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 4.7 road deaths per 100,000 of population.

You must be at least 18 years of age to drive in Austria unless you are learning under supervision and have met the relevant legal requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Austria, check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria\">Living in Guide</a> for information on requirements for residents.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n<p>If you are stopped by police on the motorway the police officer will identify him or herself. Unmarked vehicles will have a flashing electronic sign in the rear window, which reads \u2018Stopp\u2019, \u2018Polizei\u2019 and \u2019Folgen\u2019. If you are in any doubt, contact the police on the emergency number 133. Drivers have the right to ask to speak to uniformed patrol officers.</p>\n\n<p>The legal drink driving limit in Austria is 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The limit is 10 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood for coach/HGV drivers and those who have had a licence for less than two years. Penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol are severe.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry a high visibility warning vest and wear it when exiting the vehicle on the hard shoulder or in the event of breakdown. You must also have a first aid kit and a warning triangle inside the car. Only \u2018hands free\u2019 mobile telephones can be used whilst driving.</p>\n\n<p>It is no longer compulsory for cars to be driven with headlights switched on throughout the day all year round. If you are travelling in a right-hand drive car you will need headlamp converters in the form of stickers that can be put on your headlights when you are driving on the right.</p>\n\n<p>Motorists in Austria must form an emergency corridor as soon as traffic ceases to progress and congestion is imminent on motorways or dual carriageways and highways, regardless of whether emergency vehicles are already in the vicinity or not.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorway-travel\">Motorway travel</h3>\n<p>If you use Austrian motorways (\u2018Autobahn\u2019) and \u2018S\u2019 roads you must display a motorway vignette (sticker) on the inside of the windscreen of your vehicle as you enter Austria. Failure to have one will mean a heavy, on-the-spot fine. You can get a motorway vignette at all major border crossings into Austria and at larger petrol stations.</p>\n\n<p>All vehicles above 3.5 tonnes maximum permitted laden weight using motorways and expressways must have a small device - called the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.go-maut.at/\">\u2018GO-BOX \u2018</a> - attached to the windscreen. This includes larger private vehicles like motor caravans that are above the weight limit. If your vehicle is close to the weight limit you should carry proof of the maximum permitted laden weight. If your registration documents don\u2019t clearly state this, you will need to produce alternative certification, eg from a weighbridge</p>\n\n<p>The GO-BOX uses the high frequency range to communicate with toll points, making it possible to effect an automatic toll deduction without slowing down or stopping. They can be obtained for a one-off fee of Euro 5.00 at sales centres in Austria and neighbouring countries, or online.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-hauliers\">Road hauliers</h3>\n<p>There is a ban on all lorries over 7.5 tonnes laden weight (without a trailer) or over 3.5 tonnes (with a trailer) which applies throughout the year on all motorways on Saturdays between 15:00 and 24:00 and all day on Sundays and public holidays. Lorries over 7.5 tonnes laden weight are also prohibited from using motorways throughout the year between 22:00 and 05:00. There is a ban on lorries over 7.5 tonnes laden weight overtaking on several motorways. Look out for special signs.</p>\n\n<p>The Transport Ministry and ASFINAG (the semi-privatised motorway operator) carry out stringent checks on HGVs. All vehicles must be roadworthy and correctly documented. Vehicles found to have defects are likely to be impounded until the completion of necessary repairs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel-in-winter-1-november-to-15-april\">Road travel in winter (1 November to 15 April)</h3>\n\n<p>All vehicles must be adapted to winter road conditions between 1 November and 15 April. Snow chains on the driving wheels will only be allowed as an alternative where the road is fully covered by snow and/or ice and the road surface will not be damaged by the chains. Chains or summer tyres will not be allowed for slush conditions. Heavy fines or temporary loss of vehicle may be imposed on those who ignore this legislation.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorist attacks in Austria can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.
