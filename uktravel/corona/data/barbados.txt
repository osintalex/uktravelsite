Some incidents have taken place in populated and public areas. You should remain vigilant at all times and in all locations.</p>\n\n<p>You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as you would in the UK and make sure your accommodation is secure. This also applies if you are staying on a yacht. Take care when walking alone off the busy main roads and when withdrawing money from ATMs. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Many festivals have been cancelled. During any festival you should remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings.

You should take extra care on minor roads and in rural areas where there are narrow roads and blind corners.
