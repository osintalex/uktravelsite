However, since June 2019 large-scale political demonstrations have taken place throughout Hong Kong, including in areas popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities have taken place, many other protests have led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence. Protests, including some with violence, are likely to continue.</p>\n\n<p>In the light of the new national security legislation that came into effect in Hong Kong on 1 July 2020, there is a risk of heightened tension. The law introduces offences on secession, subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country. China\u2019s mainland authorities could under certain circumstances detain individuals under the terms of this law, with maximum penalty of life imprisonment. A link to the English translation of the legislation can be found <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/english/gazette/volume.php?year=2020&amp;vol=24&amp;no=48&amp;extra=1&amp;type=0\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The situation around protests and public gatherings can change quickly, with the potential for violence, especially during unauthorised protests. Recent protests have seen the use of petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails. Unauthorised protests have been met by a more rapid and severe police response, including heavy use of tear gas, bean bag rounds and \u201csponge grenades\u201d, and rubber bullets.  Police have also deployed water cannon and, very occasionally, live rounds have also been deployed. Protests can deviate from planned routes or rally locations and spill over into nearby public spaces, such as shopping centres, housing estates and public transport hubs. If you are in and around areas where demonstrations are, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations may lead to sections of the city being closed off and road blocks being set up. During recent protests, local buses, metro (MTR), Airport Express services and the Hong Kong Macao Ferry Terminal have temporarily suspended operations without warning. Violent protests have also taken place inside or near MTR stations. You should remain vigilant at all times and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/main/index.html\">check live service updates</a> on the MTR website.</p>\n\n<p>Some Mass Transit Railway (MTR) metro stations, including in major tourist areas, have been closed due to damage caused by protests. You should check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mtr.com.hk/alert/alert_simpletxt_title.html\">MTR</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.td.gov.hk/en/special_news/spnews.htm\">Hong Kong Transport Department</a> websites when planning travel around Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re due to travel, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/\">check your flight status regularly</a>, keep up to date with the latest developments via local media and consider allowing extra time to travel to the airport and complete check-in procedures.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>The level of violent crime is very low but pick pocketing and other street crime can occur. You should take extra care of passports, credit cards and money in crowded areas and when checking in and out of hotels. There have been some isolated incidents of robberies in Hong Kong\u2019s Country Parks; these incidents have been reduced following a crime prevention operation by the Hong Kong Police. Nevertheless, if you intend to hike in Hong Kong\u2019s Country Parks you should stick to marked trails and avoid carrying valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but do occur, including through drinks being spiked. You should take reasonable precautions - don\u2019t leave drinks unattended and avoid accepting drinks from strangers. Women, travelling alone or with female friends, could be at greater risk. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Hong Kong police have stated that they have discovered Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) on a number of occasions since October 2019. The police believe that devices used in October and December 2019 were intended to target police officers, while more recent devices have been aimed at a wider range of targets. No-one has been injured in these incidents to date, but there is a continuing risk of IEDs being used in Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting Hong Kong, you can drive in Hong Kong with a valid UK driving licence for up to 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning on living in Hong Kong, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/licences_and_permits/driving_licences/how_to_apply_for_a_driving_licence/driving_in_hong_kong_for_overseas_driving_licence_/index.html\">Hong Kong SAR Transport Department</a> website for more information on applying for a full or temporary driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Ongoing protest activity could affect certain road routes across Hong Kong, including the cross-harbour tunnel and other major bridges and toll plazas. In recent months, protesters have erected blockades throughout the city in areas where protests are taking place.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in Hong Kong, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

It introduces offences on secession, subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  These offences can be applied to activities conducted outside Hong Kong.  China\u2019s mainland authorities could under certain circumstances detain and try individuals under the terms of this law. There is therefore a risk for those who commit an offence under the law of being detained and removed to mainland China.  Due to recent heightened political sensitivity, there could be an increase in protests and violence. These could occur without warning, throughout Hong Kong.  You should avoid protests and demonstrations. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/hong-kong/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout 2019, large-scale political demonstrations took place all over the Hong Kong SAR, including in areas popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities have taken place, many other protests have led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence. You should keep up to date with developments across Hong Kong.
