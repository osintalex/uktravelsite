On 18 September 2018, armed, masked men purporting to be members of AQ-M posted an online video announcing their presence in Burkina Faso.</p>\n\n<p>In June 2019, Burkina Faso passed a law criminalising the dissemination of information about terrorist attacks and security forces that could undermine public order or the conduct of security operations.</p>\n\n<p>A state of emergency remains in place in the East and Sahel regions, the western provinces of Kossi and Sourou, the central-eastern province of Koulp\u00e9logo, the western province of K\u00e9n\u00e9dougou and northern province of Lorum. The measure gives security forces extra powers to search homes and restrict freedom of movement.</p>\n\n<p>Security mitigation is limited outside the capital Ouagadougou. There have been regular attacks on police, military personnel and civilians, particularly close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Cote d\u2019Ivoire and in the Eastern Region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Burkina Faso security forces, religious sites, restaurants, schools, markets and places visited by foreigners. Foreign or local government facilities may also be a target. Further attacks are possible. You should exercise particular caution around religious holidays.</p>\n\n<p>Notable recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 29-30 May 2020, around 50 people were killed in three separate attacks in the eastern Kompienga region, and in the northern provinces of Sanmatenga and Loroum. The deadliest of these attacks killed at least 25 people after unidentified gunmen opened fire at a cattle market</li>\n  <li>On 24 December 2019, 42 people were killed following a terrorist attack at a military outpost, including 35 civilians of whom 31 were women. The attack took place in Arbinda in northern Soum province, close to the border with Mali</li>\n  <li>On 1 December 2019, at least 14 people were killed after gunmen opened fire inside a church in Hantoukoura, eastern Burkina Faso</li>\n  <li>On 5 November 2019, 37 civilians were killed and 60 injured following an attack on a convoy carrying workers to a Canadian gold mine near Boungou, in eastern Burkina Faso</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have also been attacks in the capital, Ouagadougou:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In March 2018, an attack took place on the French Embassy and the Army Headquarters. 16 people were killed, including 8 attackers, and 80 people injured.</li>\n  <li>In May 2018, Burkinabe security forces engaged the suspected attackers  in the Rayongo district, on the outskirts of the capital. Three suspected terrorists were killed, and 5 gendarmes and 1 civilian wounded. Weapons and bomb-making materials were found at the scene.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Further attacks are possible and could occur without warning. You should be vigilant, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There remains a high threat of kidnap in Burkina Faso and the wider Sahel region. On 15 January 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped near Gayeri in the Est region and found dead near the Niger border 2 days later. In mid-December 2018, a Canadian and Italian were kidnapped in southwest Burkina Faso. They were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in north east Mali after reportedly escaping. In September 2018, 2 foreign nationals were kidnapped in the far north by an armed group. In January 2016, 2 western nationals were abducted in the northern town of Djibo near the border with Mali, one of whom has since been released. A number of hostages kidnapped in Burkina Faso are still being held by terrorist groups.</p>\n\n<p>This threat is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. In March 2017, AQ-M Sahel, Ansar al-Dine and al-Murabitun merged into the new group \u2018Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen\u2019, demonstrating their continued intent to conduct attacks and kidnaps across the region. There is a good chance that AQ-affiliate JNIM will continue to target foreign nationals. Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">regional threat in the Sahel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>There is a risk of armed groups stopping vehicles (including public buses) on major roads to rob them, particularly at night.</p>\n\n<p>Street crime poses high risks for visitors. Most incidents involve opportunist snatches of purses, wallets, jewellery and other valuables. Thieves are particularly active in crowds. The areas near and around the UN Circle and the former Central Market in Ouagadougou experience the highest amount of street crime. You should take sensible precautions. Don\u2019t carry valuables in public places or walk alone at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://content.met.police.uk/Site/fraudalert\">scam</a> artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims.</p>\n\n<p>You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>If you decide to travel outside of Ouagadougou against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should avoid travel between towns by road at night, particularly from Bobo Dioulasso to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Fada to Benin and Togo, due to a history of incidents in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents are not confined to principal routes. Secondary roads (notably roads in the east to Benin, Bogande and Gayeri) are also affected.</p>\n\n<p>You should also take care if you are travelling by road between Burkina Faso and Niger. You should travel in convoy where possible and seek local advice before setting out. Where possible you should follow a police patrol.</p>\n\n<p>Armed roadside banditry is a problem across the country, and the number of attacks is increasing. Drivers who have refused to stop for robbers have been shot at. Remote and border regions are particularly vulnerable but there have been attacks on the main road between Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive in Burkina Faso using a UK driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>With a few exceptions, roads are poor with few street lights. There is a risk of banditry and hitting stray livestock. Road conditions off the main roads are often difficult, especially in the rainy season (June-September). Vehicles do not always have headlights and are often in poor condition.</p>\n\n<p>Stay on clearly marked roads or tracks and avoid minor roads in remote areas unless travelling in convoy. If you break down off a main road you may not be able to attract help. Carry drinking water with you.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Burkina Faso has a large Muslim population.

See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso, including Ouagadougou. Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Burkina Faso security forces, religious sites, restaurants, schools, markets and places visited by foreigners. Further attacks are possible. You should exercise particular caution around religious holidays. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks. On 11 May 2019, four hostages, including westerners, were rescued during a French military operation in northern Burkina Faso. Two of the rescued hostages were French tourists who had been kidnapped from Pendjari National Park in Benin on 1 May 2019. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso/terrorism#kidnap\">Kidnap</a></p>\n\n<p>In June 2019, Burkina Faso passed a law criminalising the dissemination of information about terrorist attacks and security forces that could undermine public order or the conduct of security operations.</p>\n\n<p>A state of emergency remains in place in the Est and Sahel regions, the western provinces of Kossi and Sourou, the central-eastern province of Koulp\u00e9logo, the western province of K\u00e9n\u00e9dougou and northern province of Lorum. The measure gives security forces extra powers to search homes and restrict freedom of movement.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Burkina Faso as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/37/burkina-faso#Other_risks\">the National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in Burkina Faso where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel. British nationals should contact the British High Commission Accra in Ghana in the first instance who can provide consular support. The Honorary Consul in Burkina Faso can offer limited consular assistance.</p>\n\n", "document": {"id": "82552541-7a00-40a8-a340-a8deaf8bff77", "url": "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5f4e31d2e90e071c79c84cb8/FCDO__TA__006_-_Burkina_Faso_Travel_Advice_Ed1.pdf", "content_type": "application/pdf", "attachment_type": "file"}, "updated_at": "2020-10-16T09:04:50Z", "reviewed_at": "2020-10-16T09:04:50Z", "alert_status": [], "max_cache_time": 10, "email_signup_link": "/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso/email-signup", "change_description": "Update to information on the location of terrorist attacks in Burkina Faso ('Summary' and 'Terrorism' pages)", "change_history": [{"note": "Latest update: Health Section \u2013 revised guidance on sources of health information before travel", "public_timestamp": "2018-11-26T16:48:42.371Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Summary - update to information about the availability of consular support", "public_timestamp": "2018-12-14T12:29:33.454Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Summary - updated information following the declaration of a partial state of emergency on 31 December", "public_timestamp": "2019-01-02T16:49:30.234Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Summary - updated information following the extension of a partial state of emergency on 11 January for a further 6 months", "public_timestamp": "2019-01-15T11:50:37.071Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Summary - change to advice against travel; the FCO now advise against all travel to the Sahel and Est regions in full, and to the Koulp\u00e9logo province in Centre-Est region; Terrorism section (Kidnap) \u2013 update to information about the threat of kidnap and information about recent kidnap incidents in eastern Burkina Faso; Entry requirements section (Visas) -  update on applying for a visa from the UK", "public_timestamp": "2019-02-14T14:43:13.646Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Terrorism section - details of recent attacks in Soum and Koulp\u00e9logo Provinces ", "public_timestamp": "2019-05-03T09:37:20.306Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Summary - factual update; on 11 May four hostages, including westerners, were rescued during a French military operation in northern Burkina Faso; 2 of the rescued hostages were French tourists who had been kidnapped from Pendjari National Park in Benin on 1 May", "public_timestamp": "2019-05-22T16:43:00.444Z"}, {"note": "Summary - factual update; on 11 July 2019, parliament extended the state of emergency existing in some regions for a further 6 months", "public_timestamp": "2019-08-29T11:36:54.000Z"}, {"note": "Terrorism section and summary - review of information on the threat from terrorism, including kidnaps, in Burkina Faso", "public_timestamp": "2019-12-19T17:07:39.000Z"}, {"note": "Terrorism section - updated information on likely targets of attacks and addition of reference to attack in Arbinda in December 2019", "public_timestamp": "2020-01-27T19:57:25.000Z"}, {"note": "This travel advice has been reviewed in full; the FCO now advise against all travel to Burkina Faso, except the capital Ouagadougou where the FCO continue to advise against all but essential travel", "public_timestamp": "2020-02-07T17:00:48.000Z"}, {"note": "Addition of information on coronavirus (COVID-19) and measures introduced to limit the spread of the virus, following confirmed cases of the virus in Burkina Faso ('Health' and 'Summary' page)", "public_timestamp": "2020-03-10T16:06:22.000Z"}, {"note": "Addition of coronavirus (COVID-19) hotline numbers.
