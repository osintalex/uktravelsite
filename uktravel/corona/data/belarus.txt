You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"at-the-border\">At the border</h3>\n<p>There may be long queues at borders.

You should ignore any private facilitators who offer to help you pass through checkpoints and border crossings.</p>\n\n<p>You must be able to produce ownership documents or a letter of \u2018power of attorney\u2019 at border crossings. Only originals of these documents are accepted. You must have third party car insurance or you may get an on-the-spot fine. You can only buy this when entering Belarus. Ask at Customs\u2019 border offices for further information.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t overstay the temporary import terms for your vehicle.
