No more than four people are allowed in a vehicle, if they are not part of the same family. The authorities may also stop vehicles to enquire about the reason for the journey.</p>\n\n<p>It is now mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you are outside your home, unless you are alone whilst driving a vehicle or exercising. From 22 May, it is also compulsory to have Qatar\u2019s contact tracing app, Ehteraz, downloaded and working on your smartphone whenever you leave the house. The authorities are deploying mobile patrols and setting up checkpoints to prevent social gatherings and check compliance with other measures.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone violating these could incur a fine of up to QR200,000 and a prison sentence not exceeding three years, or one of those two penalties.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n\n<p>Hotels are open, and facilities (ie gyms, pool) have reopened subject to restrictions on capacity. Some hotels are being used as quarantine locations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-places-and-services\">Public places and services</h2>\n\n<p>Qatar moved to phase 4 of its roadmap for re-opening on 1 September. Parks, beaches, gyms and outdoor swimming pools have reopened, as have malls, some restaurants, museums and libraries, though with varying restrictions on entry, hours and capacity. Gatherings of up to 15 people inside and up to 30 outside can now take place as long as precautionary measures are taken. Mosques and most hairdressers have also reopened, with restrictions, and restaurants have a maximum of four people per table, or up to six from the same household.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"healthcare-in-qatar\">Healthcare in Qatar</h2>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you should contact the Ministry of Public Health\u2019s helpline on 16000.</p>\n\n<p>If you are confirmed to have coronavirus, you will be placed in isolation in one of the country\u2019s medical facilities, or asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days, depending on your symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>Emergency medical treatment is excellent but can be expensive. Routine treatment is available but expensive for visitors.

If you intend to drive using your UK licence in Qatar, you should obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP) before travelling. If you\u2019re staying longer than 12 months, you will need to apply for a Qatari driving licence and sit both the theory and practical tests.</p>\n\n<p>From 28 March 2019, the IDP you should obtain is a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Qatar after this date. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Qatar, check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/living-in-qatar\">Living in Qatar</a> guide for information on licence requirements for residents.</p>\n\n<p>Road discipline is very poor; speeds are high and minor accidents common. Qatar has very high fatality rate for road accidents. If you have an accident, stay with your vehicle. It\u2019s an offence to leave the scene of the accident, but if no one has been injured and it\u2019s safe to do so, you can move your vehicle to a safer place. You\u2019ll need to get a police report for insurance purposes.</p>\n\n<p>The driver and front seat passenger should wear a seat belt at all times. You must not use a mobile phone while driving. Even minor expressions of \u2018road rage\u2019 like rude gestures can attract significant penalties. Offenders may be fined, imprisoned and/or deported. You may be banned from leaving the country until your case has been resolved. \u00a0More serious cases may take up to 6 months to be heard.  Flashing your lights in Qatar can mean a driver is coming through, rather than giving way.</p>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert can be hazardous unless in a properly equipped 4 x 4 vehicle. Always travel in convoy with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone, and leave travel plans with friends or relatives.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s an offence in Qatar to drink and drive, and there is zero tolerance for it. Driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a custodial sentence of between one month and three years, a fine of QAR10,000 (approx \u00a32,150) to QAR50,000 (approx \u00a310,770), or both. Offenders may also be deported.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. You should make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Regional tensions may also affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by Dhow, as the safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>Regional developments continue to have an impact on local public opinion in the region.

If you\u2019re working as a journalist, you\u2019ll need to get permission from the Qatar News Agency (QNA) to film or photograph as part of your work and enter the country on a visiting press permit.

Alcohol is available at licensed hotel restaurants and bars, and expatriates living in Qatar can obtain alcohol on a permit system. Don\u2019t carry alcohol around with you (except to take it on the day of collection from the warehouse to your home). \u00a0The legal drinking age in Qatar is 21, and establishments serving alcohol will ask for original photo ID upon entry.</p>\n\n<p>Swearing and making rude gestures are considered obscene acts and offenders can be jailed or deported.

There have been cases of individuals being detained, prosecuted and/or convicted for posting this type of material.</p>\n\n<p>Qatar law also prohibits the importation, sale and purchase of electronic cigarettes, liquids and other similar products (eg electronic shisha pipes). The law applies regardless of quantity and intended use.

Any intimacy in public between men and women (including between teenagers) can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexual behaviour is illegal in Qatar. There have been some reports of individuals being punished for homosexual activity and/or sexual activity outside marriage, particularly where there is any public element, or the behaviour has caused offence.
