Protests which began on 17 October 2019 are ongoing and have picked up again as of May 2020. The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protestors, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred, including major clashes in downtown Beirut, which resulted in large numbers of casualties and the widespread use of tear gas and rubber bullets by the security forces, and clashes in Tripoli. There have been a number of deaths in the context of the protests.</p>\n\n<p>Violence between the security forces and protestors is highly likely to reoccur, including at short notice, in particular at existing flashpoints. You should remain vigilant, avoid protests, demonstrations and large political gatherings, and keep up to date with developments <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/email-signup\">via this travel advice</a> and local media, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>TV:</strong> LBCI, New TV, NBN, Future News, OTV</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Radio:</strong> Radio One 105.5 FM, Voice of Lebanon 93.3 FM, Radio Orient 88.3- 88.6 FM, Sawt El Ghad 97.1- 96.7 FM, BBC Arabic 93.1 FM</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>News websites:</strong>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.naharnet.com\">Naharnet</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nowlebanon.com\">Now Lebanon</a>, \n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb\">The Daily Star Lebanon</a> (all in English), <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/arabic\">BBC Arabic</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.elnashra.com\">Elnashra</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.tayyar.org\">Tayyar</a> (all in Arabic)</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As a result of the protests, major roads in and out of Beirut and across the country have become blocked at short notice, including the roads to and from Beirut Rafik Hariri International Airport. If you\u2019re travelling to or from the airport, check your flight status before leaving, allow extra time for your journey and ensure that you have adequate medical supplies if required. If roads from the airport are blocked, wait there until the authorities confirm access roads are open.</p>\n\n<p>The economic situation may affect your ability to pay for goods and services. As of spring 2020, the value of the Lebanese Pound has fallen rapidly against the US Dollar. Prices have increased accordingly. Banks have closed for long periods during the protests, and have increasingly become the target of attacks. While ATMs are generally stocked with Lebanese Pounds, there may be limits on daily withdrawals so check with your bank before travelling. It is very difficult to access US Dollars locally. And some companies are becoming increasingly reluctant to accept credit/debit cards so you should ensure that you have adequate cash.</p>\n\n<p>Supplies may become increasingly scarce, including at pharmacies and supermarkets. You should therefore bring any medicines you need with you to Lebanon. Fuel stations continue to supply petrol, but there have been closures and restrictions of supply at short notice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-situation\">Security situation</h3>\n<p>The security situation in Lebanon can deteriorate quickly. As well as ongoing protests, Lebanese issues or regional and international developments can have an impact on the local security situation This includes a conflict with Israel, which could spark with little warning with a rapid escalation in violence. Events in Syria and Iraq may also impact Lebanon. You are therefore advised to monitor the regional situation whilst in Lebanon.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid large crowds and political gatherings. Weapons are common in Lebanon and groups, including Hizballah, retain arms that are beyond state control. Violence can therefore quickly escalate. There have been protests targeted at UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon. \nCelebratory gunfire into the air is common throughout Lebanon, including in response to speeches and messages by political leaders. If you find yourself in an area where there\u2019s celebratory gunfire, take cover in a building and move away from windows.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of widespread disturbances or a deterioration in the security situation, there may be limits to the assistance that the British Embassy Beirut can provide. Read further information and advice on \n<a href=\"/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">how to deal with a crisis overseas</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>The risk to tourists from petty or violent crime remains moderate - however crime has increased due to the declining economic situation. This includes bag snatching, including by criminals on motorbikes,  vehicle crime and theft of mobile telephones. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Consider your route and vary daily routines. Conceal expensive looking jewellery which could draw unwanted attention. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and be aware of your surroundings when using ATMs.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in reported incidents of sexual harassment/assault in public areas, including whilst walking in Beirut. Consider whether it is safe to walk alone, particularly at night.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of armed robberies and physical attacks against passengers in shared taxis (known locally as service taxis) with passengers being attacked by either the driver or other passengers. Don\u2019t use shared taxis or taxis hailed on the street. Only use taxis from recognised companies. Hotels can advise on firms with cars that are recognised as being safe and well maintained.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2017, the Lebanese Interior Minister advised people in Lebanon not to use Uber taxis, saying \u201cI call in your name on all Lebanese not to use this Uber transport service because we do not consider it to be safe and there are taxi offices to use instead\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of criminal gangs operating in parts of the Beqaa Valley, especially northern Beqaa, involved in drug cultivation and smuggling. Car theft gangs are prevalent and will steal vehicles by force of arms, particularly along sections of the international highway towards Baalbek. Vehicle thefts have grown significantly and are often targeted by type. Other armed crimes, such as robbery and kidnap, occur in these areas. There are also frequent armed clashes between gangs, and operations by the security forces. In February 2020, five Lebanese Armed Forces soldiers (LAF) were killed in clashes with gangs in Hermel.</p>\n\n<p>On 4 October 2020, a revenge killing sparked an increase in tension between rival criminal families in the Baalbek area, which has resulted in heavily armed groups and convoys taking to the streets. The LAF has temporarily deployed a large contingent of armoured troops to conduct operations and diffuse tension. The situation is volatile and unpredictable at present. You should therefore follow the advice of security agencies, and avoid Baalbek and surrounding areas whilst operations continue.</p>\n\n<p>You can report suspicious activity to the police by dialing 112. If you or another British citizen become the victim of crime abroad, you should contact the local police and the nearest British embassy or consulate. You can find more information on how we can support you in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide\">Support for British Nationals Abroad guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>The government may restrict movements, including at short notice, to control the spread of coronavirus. For more detailed information see the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/coronavirus\">coronavirus page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ongoing protests and roadblocks may mean that travel is restricted at short notice. For more information see the section on Political situation.</p>\n\n<p>Palestinian refugee camps are volatile environments where the Lebanese state has limited capacity to impose law and order. There has been a long pattern of violent clashes in particular in Ein El Helweh camp near Saida in southern Lebanon.</p>\n\n<p>There is a UN peacekeeping presence in the area south of the Litani River. Although de-mining operations have been carried out unexploded ordnance, including cluster bombs, remain in remote areas.</p>\n\n<p>There is a military checkpoint located approximately 7km south of Tyre on the Naqoura-Tyre-Saida-Beirut highway. A pass from the LAF office in Saida is necessary to continue your journey further south towards the Israeli border. However, as the office is located in an area of Saida to which the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel, you should carefully consider whether your need for a pass is essential before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Land mines are present in Lebanon and are not always clearly marked. Use only well-travelled tracks and do not stray from their edges. Avoid remote abandoned properties. Use local guides and seek local knowledge if you\u2019re unsure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>The government may restrict movements, including at short notice, to control the spread of coronavirus. See information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/coronavirus\">measures introduced in Lebanon</a>. Roads, including the Beirut airport road, are subject to closure without notice. Following a decision from the Ministry of Interior, motorcycles in Beirut are banned from 4:59 pm until 6am. See Political Situation above.</p>\n\n<p>You must hold either an\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>, which must be certified by the Lebanese authorities on arrival, or a temporary local licence to drive in Lebanon. Temporary local licences are likely to be more time consuming and expensive than an IDP.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and the accident rate is high. Traffic lights are not always observed. It may be better to hire a car with a driver if you\u2019re inexperienced. You must wear a seat belt (if fitted). Avoid travelling at night outside towns if possible. Vehicles with diesel engines are banned.</p>\n\n<p>Carry ID with you at all times and be prepared to stop at check points to show your papers. The army have set up check points on major and minor roads.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. Islamist extremist groups will seek to target the Lebanese state, security services, and civilians, and have the intent to target foreigners inside Lebanon.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

If you plan on visiting these places, you should make sure your security arrangements are sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>There is also currently a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals specifically, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Extremist groups have in particular been known to operate within the city of Tripoli, Palestinian refugee camps and in areas close to the Syrian border - including around Hermel and Aarsal</p>\n\n<p>Politically motivated terrorist attacks also remain likely. A number of such attacks have taken place in the southern suburbs of Beirut.</p>\n\n<p>Following the arrest on 18 August 2020 of an individual suspected of preparing to conduct terrorist attacks in Beirut, there have been police and military casualties in two security incidents linked to the arrest.  On 21 August 2020, 3 municipal police officers were shot and killed in Kaftoun, Koura in the north of the country. On 14 September, 4 members of the Lebanese Armed Forces were killed during an arrest operation in Beddawi (also Beddaoui) close to Tripoli.Terrorist-related incidents in recent years have also included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>on 3 June 2019, a suspected militant killed 2 Lebanese army soldiers and one Lebanese policeman in Tripoli. The militant himself died in the subsequent operation by the Lebanese security agencies.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>on 14 January 2018, a small explosion occurred near Al-Bustan Street in Saida. One person was injured.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>on 28 and 29 June 2017, 4 attackers exploded suicide belts in a refugee settlement in Arsal. Follow-up security investigations are ongoing.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Lebanese security authorities are at a high state of alert and are conducting security operations across Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Avoid large crowds, demonstrations, political gatherings and the use of shared public transport.</p>\n\n<p>If you notice or suspect a security incident is underway, you should immediately leave the area.  Suspects have detonated explosions to avoid arrest. Keep clear of affected areas in the immediate aftermath of any attacks. Bystanders have been killed in a number of terrorist attacks in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor media reports and keep up to date with the travel advice covering your location. Remain alert to both regional tensions given Lebanon\u2019s links and proximity to Syria, and to the potential for sectarian attacks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a threat of kidnapping in Lebanon. The Lebanese authorities have warned that foreigners, including westerners could be targeted by kidnappers and other militant groups. Criminal kidnappings have occurred in the Beqaa Valley, the Syrian border regions and Beirut, but could take place anywhere in Lebanon.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist kidnappings are also possible and Daesh and other terrorist groups view those engaged in humanitarian aid work or journalism as legitimate targets.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and making concessions increases the risk of further hostage-taking.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>Lebanon is part Muslim, part Christian.

You must also self-quarantine before the test and whilst waiting for your results. If  your second test result comes back negative, you are able to end your quarantine. If your test is positive, follow Lebanese government advice. If you do not wish to take a second PCR test, you can instead choose to quarantine at your accommodation for 10 days, from the date of your arrival.</p>\n\n<p>If you have travelled from Syria, Turkey and all African countries, you must proceed to your accommodation and quarantine for 48 hours, until you receive the results of a PCR test conducted at the airport.</p>\n\n<p>All Lebanese and resident foreigners arriving from Iraq must proceed to your accommodation and quarantine for 72 hours. Within 72 hours of your arrival, you must take a second PCR test at your own expense. Should your second test results come back negative, you are able to end your quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>All other arrivals from Iraq (except Lebanese and resident foreigners) must have a pre-paid hotel booking for 72 hours in a Government of Lebanon-approved hotel, before you travel. On arrival, you must quarantine in one of these hotels for 72 hours during which time a PCR test will be conducted. You will not be allowed to leave the quarantine hotel until you receive the second test result.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Lebanese government is keeping these measures under review and they may change at short notice.

The airport remains operational, with direct and indirect commercial flights available.</p>\n\n<p>Damage and the ongoing situation at the port and in areas close to the port remains an ongoing hazard and could pose a risk to your personal safety. You should exercise caution in the area, stay away from collapsed buildings, monitor the local news and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy in Beirut has been informed by the Lebanese authorities that, exceptionally given the current situation, British nationals travelling to the UK will be permitted to depart Lebanon on an expired passport, without requiring an emergency travel document. Before travelling you should confirm with your airline that they will accept this. If you are travelling to, or transiting, another country then you will need to ensure that your passport will also be accepted there.</p>\n\n<p>On the evening of 6 August anti-government protests broke out around the Lebanese parliament and further large protests took place in Beirut on 8 August, resulting in clashes between security forces and protestors. There is an increased risk of protests and demonstrations. If you\u2019re in Beirut, you should avoid protests, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in Beirut and need urgent consular assistance, call +961 (0)1 960800. If you\u2019re in the UK and worried about a British national in Beirut, call the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> in London on 020 7008 5000. Additionally, the Lebanese Ministry of Health have set up a hotline for missing persons, +961 1 832700.</p>\n\n<p>Check our <a href=\"/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus\">advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a> and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/email-signup\">sign up for email alerts</a> for this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning travel to Lebanon, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/coronavirus\">Coronavirus section</a>.</p>\n\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover.

The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, including in the Beqaa Valley and Saida, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred across the country, often resulting in injuries to protestors and security forces.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of protests, major roads (including to and from Beirut airport) have become blocked, banks have  closed, and there is a risk that supplies (including medical) may become increasingly scarce. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Crime, including reports of sexual harassment in public spaces, has increased as a result of the economic decline in Lebanon. This includes in Beirut. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning and lead to a rapid escalation in violence. There have been exchanges between Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon. This has included cross-border shelling. The most recent such incident took place on 27 July 2020 and there remains a risk of a further escalation.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/safety-and-security#security-situation\">Security situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Previous attacks have targeted the security forces, as well as locations where Western visitors may congregate. There have been police and military casualties in recent security incidents linked to the arrest of an individual suspected of plotting a terrorist attack in Beirut. You should follow the advice of the local authorities, and check local news and this travel advice regularly.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.</p>\n\n<p>Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Offences committed under the act \u2013 including funding and supporting proscribed organisations \u2013 may be liable to prosecution in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/safety-and-security#local-travel\">Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.
