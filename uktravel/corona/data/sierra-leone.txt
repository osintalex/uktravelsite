These incidents were reported in the areas of Congo Cross, Wilkinson Road, Lumley Beach and Aberdeen.</p>\n\n<p>The greatest risk to short-stay travellers is from pick pocketing and mugging in Freetown. If you\u2019re staying for a longer period, make sure your property is secured properly and employ guards.</p>\n\n<p>You should take the following precautions against crime:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid crowds and political demonstrations</li>\n  <li>don\u2019t display or carry expensive items or large sums of money</li>\n  <li>avoid walking alone after dark</li>\n  <li>plan your transport arrangements and minimise use of public transport, taxis, poda-podas (minibuses) and Ocadas (motorbikes). Some robberies have been carried out by associates of the drivers and other passengers.</li>\n  <li>familiarise yourself with your surroundings and remain vigilant.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-crime\">Reporting crime</h3>\n<p>The Sierra Leone Police levy a SLL300,000 fee for all foreign nationals who need a police report. They are unable to issue crime reference numbers without a police report. You should make your payment to the Sierra Leone Police Revenue Generation Fund Account at the Bank of Sierra Leone and get a receipt. Don\u2019t pay the Sierra Leone Police direct.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to report a crime but do not need a crime reference number or a written report, there will be no charge.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel\u00a0</h2>\n<p>If you travel outside the Freetown peninsula, try to complete your travel during the hours of daylight, inform your employers of your whereabouts and make sure they have copies of your itinerary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-to-freetown-from-the-airport\">Travel to Freetown from the airport</h3>\n<p>Lungi airport is situated on the far side of a wide estuary from Freetown. There are several transfer options, including by road, ferry, water taxi and local boats or pirogues. British High Commission staff operate a policy of informed choice and use all of the transport options available, with the exception of local boats (such as the local canoes and wooden pirogues).</p>\n\n<p>The 3 main water taxi operators run reliable services between Freetown (Government Wharf and the Lumley area) and Lungi. Services are scheduled to align with flight arrivals and departures, with a journey time of around 25 minutes on the water. Check the times before you travel. They can also be privately chartered if you miss your crossing, though this will be more expensive. Water taxis have navigational aids, night lights and provide life jackets for passengers. They have limited rescue capability.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a ferry that operates between Lungi Tagrin and Kissy Town (in the eastern end of Freetown). The journey time is around one hour on the water. The service operates on an ad hoc basis. You should pre-plan your onward journey from there, particularly if you\u2019re arriving at night. The service offers a crossing for both foot passengers and vehicles. The ferry lacks basic safety equipment. Foreign foot passengers have reported being pick-pocketed.</p>\n\n<p>Local boats/pirogues operate without lights and any safety equipment. You should avoid using these craft.</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (May to October) rough sea conditions may lead to delays or cancellations. If you choose to cross the estuary, it\u2019s good practice to notify a reliable contact of your departure and expected arrival times and agree what action they will take if you don\u2019t arrive at the expected time.</p>\n\n<p>The journey time by road is normally between 3 and 5 hours. You should prearrange pick-up as there are no car hire facilities at the airport. You can contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-freetown\">Consular section at the British High Commission Freetown</a> for a list of Freetown-based car hire companies. British High Commission staff don\u2019t use this option for travel after dark, and rarely use it in daytime due to the risk of road traffic accidents.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to stay at an airport hotel, book early as rooms are extremely limited and in high demand.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive on your UK licence for up to one month, or with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> for the length of its validity. If you\u2019re staying longer or living in Sierra Leone, you\u2019ll need to get a Sierra Leone driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Plan your journeys outside Freetown, travel in convoy if possible and report your progress. Have a plan for what to do and where to go in case of emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you use well maintained vehicles. Erratic driving is common and motorbikes are a particular problem. Most roads have little or no lighting and have hazards like vehicles with no lights, wandering pedestrians and animals. Serious traffic accidents are common.</p>\n\n<p>Children will sometimes put a rope across the road and ask for a small donation for mending the road. These incidents are most common at the weekend and on roads to tourist beaches in the Western Area. The rope will be lifted if you indicate that you don\u2019t intend to stop. You can distinguish them from official police checkpoints, which are manned by uniformed officers with marked barriers.</p>\n\n<p>British High Commission staff avoid road travel outside the Freetown peninsula during night hours.</p>\n\n<p>British High Commission staff do not use local taxis, poda-podas (minibuses) or ocadas (motorbikes).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents in Sierra Leone can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9L\">website of the Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">audit</a>\u00a0of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Sierra Leone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n<p>Sierra Leone has many attractive beaches, but strong currents exist at some. Seek local advice about conditions. There are no lifeguards. Swimming is at your own risk. Beware of hospital waste, including needles, on Lumley beach.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>Sierra Leone has taken significant strides following 4 democratic elections since the end of its civil war in 2002 and the political situation is stable. However, you\u2019re advised to avoid any political gatherings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"services-and-utilities\">Services and utilities</h2>\n<p>No mobile network provides country-wide coverage. Some areas have no mobile reception. There\u2019s no public telephone system and landline connections are poor. It is not possible to call a Sierra Leone mobile phone from a Sierra Leone landline and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Mains water is limited. Power is improving but remains unreliable. Rented accommodation and hotels rely on generators and private water supplies.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Sierra Leone, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.
