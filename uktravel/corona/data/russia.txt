You should follow the same personal security procedures as you would anywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possibility of mugging, pick pocketing and theft in the main tourist areas and around the main railway concourses, as well as from vehicles or hotel rooms. Don\u2019t leave your bags unattended. Avoid openly carrying expensive items or anything that might easily identify you as a tourist. Avoid walking about late at night alone. Be wary of groups of women and children who beg. Don\u2019t agree to look after possessions of people you don\u2019t know, and never agree to go to a bar or a club with someone you have just met.</p>\n\n<p>Look after your passport at all times, especially in major transport hubs and busy areas. Passports have been reported stolen or lost from British nationals when in the airports in Moscow. Be particularly vigilant when passing through the airports, particularly in the baggage collection area and outside the arrivals hall.</p>\n\n<p>The spiking of drinks does happen and can lead to robbery, violence and/or abuse. Unconscious victims are often left outside, which can be life threatening in the winter months. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Official looking taxis can be unlicensed, and British nationals travelling in them have been the victims of crime. Taxi apps are a useful way to call a registered taxi. You can also ask your hotel to get a taxi for you or to give you the number of a reputable company. Don\u2019t flag down what may appear to be an official taxi or share a taxi with strangers, as you are putting yourself at risk. Where possible you should agree the fare before getting into the taxi or check that the meter is working.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors are not usually the targets of violent crime. However, in St Petersburg there have been reports of street crime where tourists have been specifically targeted. These crimes are carried out by well organised gangs.</p>\n\n<p>The police do not have to have a reason in order to stop, question or detain individuals. Bogus police officers have harassed and robbed tourists. If you\u2019re stopped, always insist on seeing identification, and report harassment or crimes to the British Embassy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n<p>Take care if you are using a dating service. A number of British nationals have been the victims of fraud. Never send money or buy items for anyone you have not met in person.</p>\n\n<p>Be wary of sending money via untraceable transfer services. There have been instances where British nationals have lost money by sending money to an unknown recipient without checking they were genuine.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>Political rallies and demonstrations occur in cities and towns across Russia, usually with notice and permission from the authorities. Unauthorised demonstrations can lead to a robust response from the Russian authorities, occasionally leading to violence. Under Russian law, actions by one person can be described as a protest, and if unauthorised this can also be subject to a robust response.</p>\n\n<p>Check the local media for the latest information, be vigilant, and avoid any demonstrations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"race\">Race</h2>\n<p>Most visitors experience no difficulties but racial discrimination may be an issue and might vary according to location. People of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent may attract unwanted attention in public places and should take care, particularly when travelling late at night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in parts of Russia due to the security situation. The North Caucasus remains an unstable and potentially dangerous region. The Russian authorities take a particularly strict attitude towards security, as well as compliance with visa and registration rules. Short-term travel restrictions are sometimes applied in relation to ongoing security operations. These are publicised at very short notice, if at all. Cross-border traffic with Georgia and Azerbaijan is also subject to restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to these parts of Russia against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you are taking a serious risk. The ability of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> and the British Embassy in Moscow to help in the case of an emergency will be severely limited.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/overseas/countrybycountry.html\">AA</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/russia\">RAC</a> offer information and advice on driving in Russia, including information on compulsory documentation and equipment. If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You will need to have a <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Russia. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Russia. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that travel between cities can take a long time given the distance, heavy traffic in big cities, and poor road conditions. Don\u2019t drive alone at night or sleep in your vehicle on the side of the road.  Don\u2019t pick up hitchhikers.</p>\n\n<p>Road safety is poor. According to statistics published by the Directorate for Road Traffic Safety there were over 169,000 road traffic accidents in Russia in 2017, causing over 19,000 deaths and over 215,000 injuries. You should be vigilant when driving, take account of weather conditions, and consider limiting or avoiding driving at night.</p>\n\n<p>It is common practice for traffic police to stop motorists for spot checks. There is a zero tolerance policy towards drink driving.</p>\n\n<p>In order to drive a vehicle into Russia, you will need to declare the vehicle with the customs authority at the point of entry. You can bring a vehicle into Russia without paying import taxes for a maximum period of 1 year.</p>\n\n<p>Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rusemb.org.uk/\">Russian Embassy</a> if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle into Russia. The British Embassy is unable to offer help to those attempting to bring vehicles into Russia without the correct documentation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n<p>All railway stations have airport-style security. All bags will be scanned and passengers will need to go through detector arches.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling by overnight train in a sleeping compartment, store valuables in the container under the bed or seat. Don\u2019t agree to look after the luggage of a fellow traveller or allow it to be stored in your compartment.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t leave your sleeping compartment unoccupied, as some compartments only have a simple lock on the sliding door. On some trains there may be an additional security device, which can be attached to the fitted handle/lock unit. There may also be a steel switch at head-height on the door panel which, when pulled down, prevents the closed door from being slid open.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>The volume and quantity of liquids, gels, aerosols, creams or pastes you can carry in  your hand luggage when going through airport screening facilities throughout Russia is limited. For more information, refer to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.favt.ru/\">Federal Air Transport Agency</a> (in Russian) or consult your airline.</p>\n\n<p>A domestic flight burst into flames during an emergency landing shortly after take-off from Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo Airport in May 2019, killing 40 passengers and 1 crew on board. A domestic flight crashed shortly after take-off from Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo Airport in February 2018 killing all on board.

This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>Travel by helicopter is often used in more remote areas of Russia, including in the oil and gas industry. In recent years there have been helicopter crashes with multiple fatalities. A helicopter crashed shortly after take-off near Igarka in August 2018, killing all on board. Be aware of the increased risk of travel by helicopter and satisfy yourself of the operator\u2019s safety record.</p>\n\n<p>The most recent <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">audit</a> of Russia\u2019s civil aviation authority by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 2015 found that the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight Russia was above the global average.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cruise-ships\">Cruise ships</h2>\n<p>According to the Russian migration authorities, around 69,000 British nationals visited St Petersburg in 2016 on sea cruise ships organised by foreign tour companies. Volga river cruises between St Petersburg and Moscow are also popular. Use recognised cruise operators with established safety records.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"disabled-access\">Disabled access</h2>\n<p>People with disabilities may face difficulties in accessing certain public areas as disabled facilities vary across Russia, and can be poor or even non-existent in places.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Russia.</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

These plots are reported to have targeted public transport and crowded places.  Terrorist groups, including Daesh and al-Qaeda aligned groups, continue to call for attacks in Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Although there\u2019s no indication that British nationals or interests have been specific targets, attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant in all public places, including major transport hubs, tourist sites and crowded areas; and particularly where access isn\u2019t controlled, for example at open-air events and markets. Previous attacks have targeted transport infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015, Daesh announced the establishment of an affiliate in the North Caucasus, and many rebel leaders announced they had switched their allegiance to Daesh. \nDaesh North Caucasus has claimed responsibility for a number of small-scale attacks (mainly in Dagestan), targeting law enforcement personnel.</p>\n\n<p>While the number of casualties from ongoing violence in the North Caucasus has reduced in recent years, there continues to be frequent attacks and skirmishes between rebel groups and Russian forces in the republics of Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria. The threat from terrorism could rise quickly in relation to any escalation of violence in the North Caucasus.</p>\n\n<p>Security services conduct frequent counter-terrorism operations in the North Caucasus and elsewhere in Russia. These can be at short notice and involve restrictions on travel.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.  You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnaps\">Kidnaps</h3>\n\n<p>A number of western nationals, including British nationals, have previously been kidnapped in the North Caucasus and some have been killed by their captors. Those engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<h3 id=\"passport-checks\">Passport checks</h3>\n\n<p>You should carry your passport with you at all times.

Failure to produce your passport when asked can lead to a fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visitor-registration\">Visitor registration</h3>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to register with the local authorities if you\u2019re staying anywhere for more than 7 working days. Your hotel will do this automatically. If you\u2019re staying in a rented or private apartment, it is your host\u2019s responsibility to carry this out. However, it is your responsibility to ensure this is done. You will need to produce evidence of the registration at passport control on departure from Russia.

You must inform them of the flight route at least 24 hours in advance and keep in regular contact with them before and during the flight. Failure to do so will result in a fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Public attitudes towards LGBT+ issues are less tolerant than in the UK, and can vary depending on location. Government officials have made derogatory comments about LGBT+ individuals. Public displays of affection may attract negative attention. The republics of the North Caucasus are particularly intolerant to LGBT+ issues. Since January 2017, credible reports have been received of the arrest, torture and extrajudicial killing of gay men in Chechnya, allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018 Russia was ranked 45th out of 49 European countries for LGBT+ rights by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://rainbow-europe.org/#8656/0/0\">ILGA-Europe</a>. There are no laws that exist to protect LGBT+ people from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and/or gender identity.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not illegal in Russia. However, in 2012, Moscow Pride was banned for 100 years. In June 2013, a law banning the promotion of \u2018non-traditional sexual relations\u2019 towards under 18s (the \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law) entered into force. There have been reports that instances of harassment, threats, and acts of violence towards the LGBT+ community have increased following the introduction of this law. While no foreign nationals have been charged or convicted under it, penalties could include arrest and detention, fines and/or deportation.</p>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT+ community before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-activities\">Religious activities</h3>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on certain religious activities, including preaching and distributing religious materials. Following recent legislation, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are considered an extremist organisation in Russia and can be subject to significant harassment from the authorities, particularly at places of worship. At least one foreign national has been detained and subsequently imprisoned for being a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, though we are not aware of any British nationals being detained for this reason. Other minority religious groups in Russia are also subject to similar discrimination, as are organisations like the Scientologists.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"it\">IT</h3>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s cybersecurity laws are changing.

Different airlines have different requirements and may refuse boarding if they are not met.</p>\n\n<p>In Moscow, express PCR COVID-19 tests are available in Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo airports as well as in a number of state and private clinics.</p>\n\n<p>On 24 September the Russian President extended the temporary measures to regulate the legal status of foreign citizens and stateless persons in Russia in connection with the threat of the spread of a new coronavirus infection.</p>\n\n<p>The period of temporary stay or permanent residence in Russia for foreigners and stateless persons, earlier extended until September 15, will be in place until December 15. During these three months, foreigners will not have to renew documents on temporary stay in Russia, including visa extensions, registration deadlines at the place of stay, temporary and permanent residence, including the extension of a residence permit.  Besides, during the period of March 15 \u2014 December 15, 2020, no decisions will be made regarding deportation, repatriation or handover to another country of foreigners and stateless persons.</p>\n\n<p>Also, relevant governmental agencies will make no decisions on reducing the period of temporary stay in Russia and stripping a person of the refugee status, as well as on revoking previously issued visas, work permissions, patents and residence permits.

Contact the nearest Russian embassy or consulate outside Russia or local migration office in Russia to find out if a visa can be issued. You also need to check with the Russian embassy, consulate or migration office on the required length of ETD validity.</p>\n\n<p>UK ETDs without a visa are accepted for airside transit only. You should check with your travel company or airline that transit zones will be available at the airports of your planned route.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"immigration-cards\">Immigration cards</h3>\n<p>You must sign an immigration card every time you arrive in Russia. This will be given to you at passport control. The card is in 2 identical parts. One part will be retained by the Immigration Officer. You should keep the other part safe as your departure from Russia could be delayed.

If you\u2019re transiting Russia when flying to/from Belarus, please contact the nearest Russian embassy or consulate to check if a transit visa is needed.</p>\n\n<p>By road: There are no legal grounds for foreigners (including British nationals) to cross the land border between Russia and Belarus.  If you\u2019re planning on driving to Russia, you\u2019ll need to take an alternative route through a different country.</p>\n\n<p>By rail:  If you\u2019re planning on travelling by rail between the two countries, you should contact your train or tour operator when you make your booking to seek their advice.  You should also consider contacting your nearest Russian embassy or consulate for advice on the latest situation for rail travellers.</p>\n\n<p>Temporary travel restrictions across Russian land borders, including with Belarus, will be in place from 30 March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Duration of these remains unspecified.</p>\n\n<p>You should make sure you have all the necessary visas for the duration of your travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs\">Customs</h3>\n<p>You can import and export foreign currency up to USD 10,000 (or equivalent) without declaring it. And you can export foreign currency up to USD 3,000 (or equivalent) without declaring it.</p>\n\n<p>If you import over USD 10,000 (or equivalent) or certain categories of goods (eg electrical items, jewellery, antiques, valuable musical instruments), you must complete a customs declaration form.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to import certain advanced electronic items (eg GPS instruments), you must get an operating licence from the Russian authorities before you travel. Check with your nearest Russian embassy or consulate for advice before your departure.</p>\n\n<p>If you complete a declaration, make sure the form is stamped by a customs official at your port of entry, otherwise your foreign currency and non-declared items may be confiscated when you leave Russia and you may be fined.</p>\n\n<p>Keep receipts of any purchases in case you need to present them when you leave Russia.</p>\n\n<p>There are strict regulations covering the export of antiques, artworks (including modern art and posters if they\u2019re particularly rare or valuable) and items of historical significance bought in Russia or imported to Russia from abroad. You\u2019ll need an export permit from the Ministry of Culture to export this type of material and each item must be declared at the point of departure. Don\u2019t attempt to import or export items that require permits without the relevant paperwork as this is a serious offence.</p>\n\n<p>For further information visit the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://eng.customs.ru/\">Russian Federal Customs Service.</a></p>\n", "slug": "entry-requirements", "title": "Entry requirements"}, {"body": "\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p><strong>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Russia on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/186/russia\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See the healthcare information in the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/russia/coronavirus\">Coronavirus section</a> for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Russia.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important.

Hospitals do not accept all cases, and require cash or credit card payments at Western rates in advance of treatment. Disposable IV supplies, syringes and needles are standard practice in urban areas; however if you plan to travel in remote areas, you may wish to bring your own supplies.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>The UNAIDS Data 2018 Report estimated that around 1 million people in Russia are living with HIV.  The prevalence percentage was estimated at around 0.7% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage rate in adults in the UK of around 0.2%.  You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.  Due to uncertainties with the local blood supply, non-essential and elective surgeries are not recommended.</p>\n\n<p>Air quality in Moscow varies and can worsen in certain weather conditions.

The Arctic is a vast region, comprising the northerly areas of Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Alaska (United States). In addition to reading the specific travel advice for each of these countries, prospective visitors to the Arctic should also consider the potential remoteness of certain destinations from search and rescue, evacuation and medical facilities. Independent travellers are particularly advised to develop contingency arrangements for emergency back-up.</p>\n\n<p>The most popular way of visiting the Arctic is by ship. As some areas of the Arctic -specifically the more northerly and remote regions - can be uncharted and ice-covered, you should check the previous operational experience of cruise and other operators offering travel in the region. You should also consider the on-board medical facilities of cruise ships and talk to cruise operators as appropriate, particularly if you have a pre-existing medical condition.</p>\n\n<p>The 8 Arctic States take their international search and rescue obligations very seriously, and have recently signed a binding agreement on search and rescue co-operation in the Arctic.  However, in the highest latitude regions of the Arctic, cruise ships may be operating in relative isolation from other vessels and/or inhabited areas. You should be aware that in these regions, search and rescue response will often need to be despatched from many hundreds of miles away, and assistance to stranded vessels may take several days to arrive, particularly in bad weather. Search and rescue assets are also likely to offer only basic transport and basic medical care, and are unlikely to be capable of advanced life-support. Responsible cruise operators should happily provide additional information relevant to the circumstances of the cruise they are offering, and address any concerns you may have.</p>\n\n<p>Consular assistance and support to British nationals in the Arctic will be affected by the capacity of national and local authorities.
