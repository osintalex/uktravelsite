Illegal armed groups and other criminal groups are heavily involved in the drugs trade and serious crime including kidnapping (for ransom and political purposes), money laundering and running extortion and prostitution rackets.</p>\n\n<p>Street crime is a problem in major cities, including Bogota, Medellin, Cali and the Caribbean coast. Mugging and pickpocketing can be accompanied by violence. British nationals have been robbed at gun point in the Candelaria area of Bogot\u00e1. Be vigilant, particularly if you are in public places used by foreigners, or near official buildings. Avoid deprived areas of cities. Take care on city streets, especially after dark or if you are on your own. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or wear valuable watches or jewellery. Avoid using your mobile phone in the street.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy has received reports of criminals in Colombia using drugs to subdue their victims. This includes the use of scopolamine, which temporarily incapacitates unsuspecting victims.  Drugs can be administered through food, drinks, cigarettes, aerosols and even paper flyers. Victims become disoriented quickly and are vulnerable to robbery, sexual assault, rape and other crimes. Avoid leaving food or drinks unattended and don\u2019t take anything from strangers.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible, plan how you will travel to and from your destination. Only use pre-booked taxis. Be wary if you are approached by a stranger.</p>\n\n<p>Fake police are known to operate in Bogota and elsewhere to conduct scams, eg, asking to inspect money to see if it is counterfeit. If approached, you should ask to be escorted to the nearest CAI (\u2018Centro de Atencion Inmediata\u2019 \u2013 local police station).</p>\n\n<p>Express kidnappings - short-term opportunistic abductions, aimed at extracting cash from the victim - also occur. Victims can be targeted or selected at random and held while criminals empty their bank accounts with stolen cash cards. Most cases in major cities involve victims that have been picked up by taxis hailed from the street. There have been incidents where those who have resisted the kidnappers\u2019 demands have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Drugs, organised crime and terrorism are inextricably linked. Control of the drugs trade is a major driver of much of the armed conflict. There\u2019s evidence of high levels of coca cultivation in the following Departments in Colombia: Nari\u00f1o, Cauca, Putumayo, Caquet\u00e1, Meta,Guaviare, the Catatumbo region in the Norte de Santander department, northern Antioquia, and southern Bolivar. There\u2019s a risk to your safety in any area where coca, marijuana or opium poppies are cultivated and near to cocaine processing labs.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are active in all of the departments where coca is cultivated, processed or transported, as well as in many cities. The risk is particularly significant in rural areas near to the borders with Panama, Venezuela and Ecuador; in the Parque Nacional Natural de La Macarena in the Department of Meta; and the port towns of Buenaventura in the Department of Valle de Cauca, Turbo in the Department of Antioquia and Tumaco in the Department of Nari\u00f1o.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>In many rural areas the authority of the Colombian state is limited, and the British Embassy\u2019s ability to help British nationals in trouble in these areas will also be limited. If you travel to remote areas, travel with recognised tour operators, and make arrangements for your security throughout your visit. You should also seek up-to-date advice from the local authorities before each stage of your journey. Mobile and internet connection in rural areas is often limited.The Pacific coast of Choc\u00f3 is a popular eco-tourist destination. However, much of Choc\u00f3 is remote. Illegal armed groups are active and involved in the drugs trade throughout the department and particularly near the border with Panama. If you intend to travel to the whale-watching towns of Bahia Solano and Nuqui, only do so by air and don\u2019t travel inland or along the coast out of town.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to the \u2018Lost City\u2019 in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, you should only do so as part of an organised tour.</p>\n\n<p>The archaeological park at San Agustin is located in the department of Huila. You should enter and leave the park on the main road through Neiva or Popay\u00e1n.</p>\n\n<p>The tourist site of Ca\u00f1o Cristales is located in the department of Meta, in the Parque Nacional Natural de la Macarena.  If you\u2019re travelling to Ca\u00f1o Cristales, only do so with a reputable tour company, and travel by air to and from the town of La Macarena.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>You should exercise caution when taking public transport in Colombia. Do not hail taxis on the street. There have been reports of express kidnappings, assaults and robberies in unlicensed taxis. Use licensed telephone or internet-based taxi services whenever possible or book through your hotel. Many restaurants in Colombia will book a taxi for you.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://eldorado.aero/en/services/means-of-transportation/\">El Dorado International Airport</a> in Bogot\u00e1 only allows authorised taxis to pick up passengers at their terminals. Authorised taxi booths are present in El Dorado and most airports in Colombia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-coach-services\">Buses and coach services</h3>\n\n<p>There have been several recent incidents of armed robberies on buses. \nAvoid displaying valuable items like laptops, cameras and mobile phones. Don\u2019t wear jewellery and only carry minimal amounts of cash. Avoid travelling on your own or at night, especially at border crossings or areas where there are few other people around. When travelling to remote areas it may be safer to travel with others or take part in a tour with a reputable company.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting Colombia, you can drive with a valid UK driving licence for the duration of your legal stay. If you\u2019re living in Colombia, you will need to apply for a local driving licence. More information is available from the Colombian Ministry of Transport.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and traffic accidents are common. Avoid driving at night, which can be particularly hazardous. Don\u2019t hitch-hike. The risk of violence and kidnapping is higher in some rural areas, and there is a risk of being caught in roadblocks set up by illegal armed groups. Main roads are generally safe during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>The departmental capitals of Amazonas, Vaupes and Guain\u00eda are only accessible by air due to the lack of road infrastructure in these departments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"land-border-crossings\">Land border crossings</h3>\n\n<p>All borders are currently closed due to coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> currently advise against all travel to Venezuela\u2019s border regions with Colombia.

Since 1990 Colombia has had a multi-party system. Colombia\u2019s last Presidential elections took place in June 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Colombia suffered from internal armed conflict for over 50 years. On 24 November 2016, Colombia\u2019s President Santos signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla movement to end the internal armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>This peace agreement comes after four years of negotiations. On 1 September 2017, the FARC announced the launch of their new political party, officially ending their status as an armed group.</p>\n\n<p>The Colombian constitution guarantees extensive rights to indigenous and Afro-Colombian groups over their traditional territories and to protect their culture. Indigenous communities have special jurisdiction within their territories within the bounds of the national judicial system.</p>\n\n<p>Political demonstrations can occur in the capital city of Bogota and throughout the country. These can be confrontational and occasionally turn violent. You should monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Colombia.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

On 17 January, the ELN conducted a vehicle-bomb attack on a police academy in Bogota, killing 23 people.</p>\n\n<p>The FARC handed its weapons in, as part of Colombia\u2019s 2016 peace deal, on 27 June 2017, marking the end of their status as an armed group. However, dissident groups of the FARC still exist, including one led by prominent ex-commander Ivan Marquez thought to be operating from inside Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p>These groups may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Police and military personnel and installations, are frequently targeted.</p>\n\n<p>The principal intended target of these attacks is not usually foreign tourists. However, the pattern of these attacks means that incidents in public spaces and other areas visited by foreigners can\u2019t be ruled out. Past methods of attack have included car bombs, grenade attacks and explosive devices left in buildings. You should always remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local security authorities should an incident occur.</p>\n\n<p>In many areas of Colombia, the security situation can change very quickly. You should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Colombian authorities and monitor this travel advice. You should be particularly cautious and vigilant during any major events.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high risk of kidnap from both terrorist and criminal groups. While Colombians are the primary targets, foreigners can also be targeted, especially those working for (or believed to be working for) oil, mining and related companies.</p>\n\n<p>You should regularly reassess your security arrangements and consider carefully any travel around the country.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.
