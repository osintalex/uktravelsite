While many of these demonstrations are peaceful, there have been frequent violent clashes between Iraqi security forces and protesters, resulting in significant casualties including loss of life. You should avoid any rallies, marches and / or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There may be restrictions on movement, and the Iraqi authorities have discretion to impose curfews as they deem necessary. Curfews and vehicle bans can be enforced at short notice, particularly during protests and civil unrest, but also around religious holidays, pilgrimages and key political dates like elections. Religious gatherings have previously been targeted by terrorists.</p>\n\n<p>British government officials serving in Iraq live and work under strict security rules. Depending on the threat level, they may be prevented from travelling to certain areas of Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling or moving to Iraq, you should take appropriate security precautions before travelling.

There is particular risk in mountainous areas, particularly around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey.

However, the risk of terrorist attacks in Iraq remains. Attacks are more frequent in areas where Da\u2019esh had a strong presence and capability, such as Anbar, Baghdad, Ninewah, Salah-Al-Din, Diyala and Tam\u2019mim (Kirkuk) provinces, but can occur throughout the entire country.</p>\n\n<p>While the Kurdistan Region has a different security environment to the rest of Iraq, there remains a risk of attacks by Da\u2019esh.</p>\n\n<p>Targets for terrorist attacks have included: residential compounds, military establishments, oil facilities, airports, public transport, commercial venues, including markets and stores, maritime facilities, land border crossings, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, large crowds, police stations, political offices/events, sports venues/stadiums and religious sites/ceremonies. There is a heightened threat of attacks against western interests. While attacks can take place at any time, there\u2019s a heightened threat during religious or public holidays.</p>\n\n<p>Methods of attack have included shootings, large-scale co-ordinated bombings designed to cause mass casualties, suicide bombs, vehicle bombs, rockets and mortars.</p>\n\n<p>Other militant groups opposed to western presence in Iraq continue to pose a threat to UK and other interests in Iraq \u2013 including threats on Global Coalition military bases, diplomatic premises, and foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals, including those of non-western appearance, are high value targets for terrorists, insurgents and criminals. Indiscriminate attacks against public places and Iraqi civilians also occur.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.

Kidnappings can be for purely ideological reasons as well as financial or political gain. British nationals have previously been targeted.</p>\n\n<p>You should regularly reassess your security arrangements and consider carefully any travel around the country. Close protection security is important, but does not remove the threat; a number of previous kidnap victims had security arrangements in place.</p>\n\n<p>The US Overseas Security Advisory Council has previously issued warnings over the risk of kidnapping attempts on the vehicles of non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff providing aid to Mosul and on the elevated kidnap risk to US citizens in Baghdad and wider Iraq, linked to the elevated tensions between the US and Iran.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.

You should remain vigilant, have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place, keeping these under review, and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of a sudden deterioration in the security station, there may be limits to the assistance the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can provide. You should not assume that the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> will be able to provide assistance to leave the country.</p>\n\n<p>According to Iraqi law you must have a visa before you travel, even if you\u2019re intending to travel to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/entry-requirements#Visas\">Visas</a></p>\n\n<p>The Iraqi Prime Minister announced the territorial defeat of Da\u2019esh in Iraq on 9 December 2017. However, terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out attacks in Iraq.  You should remain vigilant and monitor media reports. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country, from both Daesh and other terrorist and militant groups, which can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. You should review your security arrangements regularly and consider carefully any travel plans around the country.

There is particular risk in mountainous areas, especially around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/safety-and-security/#kurdistan-region\">Kurdistan Region</a></p>\n\n<p>The government of Iraq is taking measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam as there is a risk the dam could fail. It\u2019s currently impossible to accurately predict if or when this might occur.
