You should be aware of this, take sensible precautions in your daily movements and avoid confrontation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Pick pocketing and street crime are risks in common parts of Dakar, particularly around Place de l\u2019Ind\u00e9pendence, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche as well as Gor\u00e9e Island. This type of crime is more common in the run-up to religious festivals, and can increase early in the month after salaries are paid. There has also been an increase in crime in the context of COVID-19. Recent examples of street crime have also included attackers grabbing bags whilst driving scooters or motorbikes. You should be vigilant and take sensible precautions: e.g. avoid walking alone in the evening and after dark, be alert if using a mobile phone in public and avoid carrying valuables and bags in public.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re expecting someone to collect you at the airport, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off.</p>\n\n<p>Home robberies and armed robberies are becoming more frequent. Assaults usually take place early in the morning and after dusk.</p>\n\n<p>Be cautious when changing cash given the risk of false money circulating.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. Scams come in many forms (romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities) and can pose a great financial risk to victims. You should be cautious about requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face-to-face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. This includes requests from people who claim to be victims of various Western African conflicts (notably refugees from Sierra Leone) or relatives of present or former political leaders.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>President Macky Sall was re-elected for a second term in February 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Strikes by teachers\u2019 unions and student bodies, and demonstrations about political issues and the cost of living, are a relatively frequent occurrence, particularly in Dakar but also other cities.</p>\n\n<p>These are normally peaceful, but can sometimes turn violent. You should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place, monitor the local media for information about forthcoming protests, and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>The Senegal-Gambia border is now open; Senegal\u2019s other land borders remain closed.</p>\n\n<p>The Casamance region of south-western Senegal (between the southern border of Gambia and the northern border of Guinea-Bissau) has suffered for decades from low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation has improved significantly since 2012. The main faction of the separatist MFDC (Movement of the Democratic Forces of Casamance) declared a ceasefire in 2014, and political discussions with the government are ongoing. Armed separatist groups are, however, still present in Casamance, and the region continues to suffer from banditry. On 7 January 2018, 13 Senegalese nationals were killed, and a further seven injured in an attack by gunmen in Ziguinchor, Casamance region in the south of Senegal. There are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers, businesses or villages.</p>\n\n<p>There are sometimes military operations in the region. As of June 2020, military operations are underway in Casamance, so there is a risk of heightened tension and armed confrontation in this area.</p>\n\n<p>Land mines remain a hazard in certain areas of the Casamance, and have caused several hundred deaths since 1990. On 15 June 2020, a military vehicle hit an anti-tank mine, killing three Senegalese soldiers. This came two days after another military vehicle hit a landmine. There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance.</p>\n\n<p>De-mining operations are ongoing. Stick to paved roads where possible.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant when travelling in the Casamance region and monitor the local security situation before travelling. Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Senegal with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months, or on a valid <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. If you\u2019re staying longer or living in Senegal, you\u2019ll need to get a Senegalese driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>While some main roads are of good quality, other roads can be poor especially during the rainy season from June to September. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling during the rainy season.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are unpredictable. Some taxis and public mini-buses (\u2018car rapide\u2019) are not roadworthy by UK standards.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic congestion also increases throughout Senegal in the run up to and during religious festivals. You should take particular care and attention to avoid accidents. Driving after dark is more dangerous because of poor street and vehicle lighting. If you do have an accident you must contact the police and wait for them to arrive at the scene. In more remote areas you may need to go directly to the nearest police station in order to report the incident.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Senegal.</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Be especially vigilant in these locations.</p>\n\n<p>Senegal contributes to the UN peacekeeping initiative in Mali (MINUSMA) and is therefore considered a legitimate target by terrorist groups including Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and their associated groups.</p>\n\n<p>JNIM mainly operate in the Sahel. The Sahel region includes Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad but the threat may extend to other neighbouring countries, including Senegal, and the wider region due to the porous nature of the borders and the desire from these groups to demonstrate capability and influence across the wider region.

You should take particular care in remote regions and border areas. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking and finances terrorist activity. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.

See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Strikes, political demonstrations and social protests are a relatively frequent occurrence in Senegal, particularly in Dakar but also other cities. These are normally peaceful, but can sometimes turn violent. You should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing and street crime are common in parts of Dakar, particularly around Place de l\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche, as well as Gor\u00e9e  Island. Be cautious when changing cash given the risk of false money circulating. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/senegal/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Senegal. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/senegal/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant when travelling in Casamance, the region south of The Gambia. Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. The Casamance region has suffered from decades of low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. While the security situation has improved significantly since 2012, there are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers. There are sometimes military operations in the region. As of June 2020, military operations are underway in Casamance, so there is a risk of heightened tension and armed confrontation in this area. Mines remain in this area from years of conflict. On 15 June 2020, a military vehicle hit an anti-tank mine, killing three Senegalese soldiers. This came two days after another military vehicle hit a landmine. There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/senegal/safety-and-security\">Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Most visits to Senegal are trouble-free.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Given the rapidly changing situation in Senegal we temporarily withdrew a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our Embassy in March. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Senegal.</p>\n\n", "updated_at": "2020-10-22T11:20:52Z", "reviewed_at": "2020-10-22T11:20:52Z", "alert_status": [], "max_cache_time": 10, "email_signup_link": "/foreign-travel-advice/senegal/email-signup", "change_description": "Addition of information on the re-opening of the Senegal-Gambia border (\u2018Coronavirus\u2019 and \u2018Safety and security\u2019 pages)", "change_history": [{"note": "Latest update: Summary - revised information in run up to presidential election; there are likely to be political rallies and demonstrations in Dakar, with a risk of potential unrest; you should avoid any protests, demonstrations and areas where large public gatherings are likely\r\n", "public_timestamp": "2019-01-18T15:46:52.227Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Summary - revised information in run up to presidential election; there are likely to be political rallies and demonstrations in Dakar and other cities, with a risk of potential unrest; you should avoid any protests, demonstrations and areas where large public gatherings are likely ", "public_timestamp": "2019-02-12T13:51:48.585Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Summary - Presidential elections on 24 February passed peacefully, but a risk of demonstrations in Dakar and other cities remains ahead of the results being announced in the coming days; avoid any demonstrations and areas where large public gatherings are likely", "public_timestamp": "2019-02-26T11:32:48.482Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Summary - Presidential elections on 24 February passed peacefully, with the re-election of President Macky Sall, for a second term; you should continue to exercise caution and avoid any demonstrations and large public gatherings", "public_timestamp": "2019-03-07T09:09:48.943Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Safety and security section (Road travel) - addition of information about driving licence requirements ", "public_timestamp": "2019-03-28T15:51:34.823Z"}, {"note": "Summary - updated information on safety.
