You should take sensible precautions with your personal safety. Don\u2019t walk around late at night alone. Keep valuables, particularly cameras and passports, out of sight. Keep a photocopy of the personal details page of your passport in a safe place, or with friends or family in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>A large proportion of the population has access to arms under the government of Eritrea\u2019s civilian militia programme. We have no evidence that these weapons increase the threat of violent crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are extensive mine fields in Eritrea, especially in border areas. Driving on main roads away from border areas is generally safe.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel within 25km of Eritrea\u2019s border with Ethiopia, with the exception of the town of Senafe, and the border crossings at Debay Sima \u2013 Burre, Serha \u2013 Zalambessa and Kesadika (Adi Kuala) \u2013 Rama. All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed - travellers should check local advice before proceeding to the border.  In the border area use main paved roads and avoid driving on non-metalled roads and walking or hiking in the countryside. In September 2011, a landmine exploded on the road between Senafe and Afoma, to the east of Senafe, killing 5 people.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel within 25 km of Eritrea\u2019s border with Djibouti. In 2008 there was fighting between Djibouti and Eritrea after an incursion of Eritrean forces into the disputed Djibouti border region. Though relations have improved, the situation remains unresolved.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to Eritrea\u2019s border with Sudan, with the exception of the road to, and main town of Tessenei. There are ongoing reports of banditry in and around the border area.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling after dark in rural areas. Road signage and barriers are scarce, road surfaces are uneven \u2013 causing erratic driving. Tight blind bends and steep drops are common. In many parts of the country, roads are difficult or impassable during the rainy season.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the proximity of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, it\u2019s highly unlikely permission would be granted to visit the south western Hanish islands that belong to Eritrea.</p>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals must apply in advance for a travel permit to leave Asmara and the surrounding province of zoba Maekel. There are checkpoints outside of Asmara where your travel permit will be checked. Those working outside Asmara also need a travel permit to leave their area of residence or work. Applications in Asmara are handled by the relevant Ministry. For business travellers, applications are dealt with by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Applications outside Asmara are handled by the local Zoba (Region) Administration Offices. Permission may take several days to be granted and is sometimes refused or delayed.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists wishing to travel outside Asmara should apply for a travel permit at the Ministry of Tourism located on Harnet Avenue in Asmara. Processing usually takes around 24 hours. When applying for permission to travel outside of Asmara, you should supply details of the car you\u2019ll be travelling in. There have been reports of tourists not being permitted to use public transport to travel outside of Asmara and having to rent a car or use a private taxi.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions on travel by foreign nationals apply equally to foreign diplomats. Staff from the British Embassy therefore can\u2019t easily provide consular assistance to British nationals outside Asmara.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Mariners must seek permissions and entry visas before attempting to land in Eritrea.  This includes all islands in the Red Sea that belong to Eritrea.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the proximity of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, it\u2019s highly unlikely permission would be granted to visit the south western Hanish islands that belong to Eritrea. Those landing without a permit have previously been detained.</p>\n\n<p>Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant.</p>\n\n<p>Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue.</p>\n\n<p>The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.
