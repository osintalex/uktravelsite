The situation in the capital, Bangui remains fragile with periodic instances of killings, looting and gunfire. There are armed patrols in Bangui and you will encounter several roadblocks - official and unofficial - that are likely to be manned by armed personnel. Take particular care when approaching these. You are strongly advised not to travel around Bangui especially after dark. You should take extreme care, and travel in groups if possible.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation has deteriorated considerably in several geographic areas, including Birao in September 2019 , Ndele in March 2020, Obo and Batangafo in April 2020 and the West in June 2020.</p>\n\n<p>On 9 June, two simultaneous attacks by the 3R armed group targeted military training bases 3km east of Bouar, Nana-Mamb\u00e9r\u00e9 prefecture and a joint UN Peacekeeping (MINUSCA)\u2013Central African Republic Armed Forces (FACA) checkpoint in Pougol (28km west of Paoua) in Ouham Pend\u00e9 Prefecture.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Incidents of theft and robbery occur regularly and armed gangs are known to operate in the outlying areas of Bangui.

IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in CAR after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. It may be extremely difficult to obtain an IDP in CAR. We recommend buying one in the UK before departure.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are poorly maintained and most require a four-wheel drive vehicle. Road travel is particularly difficult during the wet season (May to November). If you do decide to travel by road, you should keep a private supply of fuel if possible and carry supplies with you if travelling outside Bangui.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal road blocks operate in remote areas. You may be forced to hand over money or possessions in order to continue your journey. There have been indiscriminate and violent attacks on travellers in remote areas.

The interim leader, Michel Djotodia, stood down on 11 January 2014 and was replaced by a transitional government. In early 2016 Presidential and legislative elections were held, leading to the inauguration of President Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra  on 30 March 2016 and the installation of a new Parliament and government. Despite this change and an increase in the number of international security forces in CAR, the situation in Bangui and the rest of the country remains fragile as reports of widespread looting and violence continue. On February 6 2019, President Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra signed a peace agreement with all 14 major armed groups in CAR under an AU-led initiative.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep up to date with local political developments and avoid all political rallies, demonstrations or large public gatherings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in the Central African Republic as there is no British Embassy.
