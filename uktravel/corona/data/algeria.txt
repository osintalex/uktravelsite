Ideally, travel around with someone who knows the city well. Avoid areas that you don\u2019t know, particularly in the suburbs of the city and especially after dark. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or valuables around with you. If you plan to tour the Casbah area of Algiers, use a good local guide and make sure local police and your hosts/hotel know about your plans. Don\u2019t accept lifts from people you don\u2019t know - use a taxi service recommended by the hotel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-arrangements\">Security arrangements</h3>\n<p>The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. In cities there\u2019s a clear security presence, which can feel intrusive. Authorities will want to know your travel plans when travelling outside major cities and may assign police or gendarmes to protect you.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling independently, inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your plans. Your hotel should be able to help you with contacting local authorities. This doesn\u2019t apply if you have dual Algerian nationality. You should accept any security escort you\u2019re offered and co-operate with authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Although you may drive in Algeria with a valid UK driving licence for a maximum of 3 months, the Algerian authorities may also request an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. You\u2019re strongly advised to apply for a valid IDP for your temporary stay in Algeria. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.

Algeria has a very high road traffic accident rate. If possible travel in a convoy of at least 2-3 vehicles outside the main towns.</p>\n\n<p>If you are taking a taxi, ask your hotel to phone a reputable firm and don\u2019t allow other unknown passengers to join you during the journey. Arrange with the driver to collect you for the return journey as taxis are not widely available, particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-nationals\">Dual nationals</h2>\n<p>Algerian family law is different from UK law.

The largest presence is in the southern desert region and in areas bordering Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali and Mauritania. Terrorists also operate in small numbers in mountainous areas in the north. However, there remains a high risk of terrorist attacks throughout the country including in Algiers and other major cities, and against UK and Western interests.  It is possible that terrorist groups will exploit targets of opportunity for attack or kidnap.</p>\n\n<p>The main terrorist threat is from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and other regional Islamist groups including Al Murabitun and Daesh-affiliates. There\u2019s also a threat from individuals inspired by Daesh. These groups have been active across the country and pose a threat throughout Algeria, including in Algiers and other major cities.</p>\n\n<p>The threat from terrorism is higher in some parts of the country:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the southern border (where the kidnap risk is concentrated)</li>\n  <li>the Libyan and Tunisian borders;</li>\n  <li>rural, and in particular mountainous, areas in the north and between Tunisia and Algiers;</li>\n  <li>the Sahara.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Algerian authorities continue to conduct effective counter terrorism operations to disrupt terrorist activity but there\u2019s a continuing threat of further terrorist attacks. You should be vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks against Algerian government interests and security forces, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 27 June 2020, two soldiers were killed whilst conducting a search and sweep operation in the province of Medea, south of Algiers. AQIM is reported to have claimed responsibility.</li>\n  <li>on 20 June, an ambush in Ain Defla, North West Algeria, led to the death of an Algerian army corporal. AQIM is reported to have claimed responsibility.</li>\n  <li>on 9 February 2020, one Algerian soldier was killed in a suicide attack on a military outpost in Timeaouine, close to the Malian border. Daesh is reported to have claimed responsibility.</li>\n  <li>on 18 November 2019 in the southern Tamanrasset region of Algeria, claimed by Daesh.</li>\n  <li>on 31 August 2017, 2 police officers were killed during a suicide attack on the regional police headquarters building in Tiaret, 130km south-west of Algiers. Daesh is reported to have claimed responsibility.</li>\n  <li>on 26 February 2017, 2 police officers were injured during an attempted suicide attack on a police station in central Constantine.</li>\n  <li>on 28 October 2016 a police officer was killed, also in Constantine.  Both this and the 26 February 2017 attack were claimed by Daesh.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been attacks and threats made against foreign and economic interests, including oil and gas facilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 18 March 2016, AQ-M attacked the In Salah Gas Joint Venture in central Algeria with explosive munitions fired from a distance. There were no injuries or casualties.</li>\n  <li>on 16 January 2013 Al Murabitun attacked a gas plant near In Amenas killing 40 foreign workers, including 6 British nationals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a kidnap threat to visitors in Algeria, particularly in the southern and eastern border areas (bordering Mali and Libya respectively).

See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">Sahel page</a> for information on the Sahel regional threat.</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya, Mauritania and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>The presence of violent extremist groups in northern Mali continues to fuel mounting insecurity across the Sahel.

However protests can occur at short notice throughout the country. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/algeria/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Algeria, including kidnappings. Terrorist attacks have focused on the Algerian state, but attacks could be indiscriminate and include foreigners. There\u2019s also a risk that lone actors could target foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times and take additional security precautions, especially in: towns and cities; the southern, Libyan and Tunisian border areas; rural and mountainous areas in the north; and the Sahara. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/algeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. If you\u2019re travelling independently, you should notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your plans. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/algeria/safety-and-security#security-arrangements\">Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>When moving around Algiers and the other main cities, avoid areas that you don\u2019t know, especially after dark. Travelling in rural areas and at night is particularly risky and it\u2019s always advisable to travel with a reputable guide or companion in these areas. Avoid travel by road at night outside the major cities and motorways.
