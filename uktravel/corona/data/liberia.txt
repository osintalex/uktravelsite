To avoid straying into these areas, use the main roads when travelling in these counties.</p>\n\n<p>The ability of the national authorities to provide emergency help outside Monrovia is limited. Check the security situation before travelling to any part of the country. Violent incidents, particularly in rural areas, are possible as a result of land disputes, illegal mining and occupation of rubber plantations. Organised groups of former combatants may be present in areas of the country where there is limited government security presence, including Sinoe rubber plantation and Sapo National Park.</p>\n\n<p>The Samuel K Doe Stadium in Monrovia can become overcrowded during major football matches or events.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Most visits to Liberia are incident free but there is a high level of crime in Monrovia, including armed robbery. Foreigners are occasionally targeted, although Liberians are the main victims of crime. The Liberian National Police has very limited capability to prevent or detect crime, or to provide emergency response in any part of the country. Levels of crime are much higher after dark. Don\u2019t walk anywhere in the city at night.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when walking alone and only do so during daylight hours.  Avoid areas where there are few people, such as beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Most crime is opportunistic theft, but there are organised criminal gangs. Thieves are often armed with knives or machetes, but occasionally also carry firearms. While Liberians are the main victims of crime, the relative wealth of international visitors makes them an attractive target for criminals. Avoid carrying valuables in public and be vigilant at all times, especially at night. Mobile phones and laptops are common targets of theft.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners have been mugged in the Mamba Point and Sinkor areas of Monrovia (including Sinkor beach in broad daylight), where most international visitors stay. Be wary if you are approached by strangers. Criminals also operate in nightclubs and on beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Accommodation occupied by international workers has occasionally been targeted by burglars. Thefts have occurred in taxis. You should avoid local public transport. There is a high incidence of rape in Liberia. There have been cases of rapes and attempted rapes involving foreign women although these are rare.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving in heavy traffic or off the main roads.</p>\n\n<p>Consider your security arrangements carefully before your arrival in Liberia. Stay only in reputable accommodation with adequate guarding and other security arrangements, and arrange for transport, including travel to and from the airport in advance. Roberts International Airport is around 30 miles from central Monrovia, much of the journey passing through rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road Travel</h3>\n\n<p>An International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended. A temporary local licence may be obtained on production of a UK licence, but this may be time consuming and more expensive. From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Liberia after this date.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The roads from Monrovia to Roberts International Airport, the port town of Buchanan and to the border with Sierra Leone at Bo Waterside, and to the border with Guinea at Ganta are mainly paved and in reasonable condition. Most other roads outside Monrovia are unpaved. Driving and road conditions deteriorate significantly during the rainy season (May to November), and many roads may become impassable.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling at night outside Monrovia, except to or from Roberts International Airport. Roads are treacherous and all roads are unlit. Vehicles often do not have lights. You are more vulnerable to being robbed at an illegal check point at night.</p>\n\n<p>Make precautionary arrangements for dealing with breakdowns, including considering travel with more than one vehicle. Traffic accidents can quickly draw hostile crowds, who may attempt to take justice into their own hands. Use a local driver outside Monrovia rather than driving yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is generally poor. Be particularly alert to dangers from other vehicles swerving to avoid potholes and from taxis slowing or stopping unpredictably to pick up or drop off passengers and motorcycle taxis \u2018Pein-Peins\u2019 (the main cause of road accidents). Motorcycle taxis are very dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Be prepared to stop at checkpoints operated by the Liberian National Police, or other Liberian security authorities, which are found on roads throughout the country. Pull over to the side of the road immediately when instructed by security forces accompanying VIP convoys.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air Travel</h3>\n\n<p>All air carriers certified only by Liberia have been <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/air-safety-list_en.pdf\">refused permission</a>\u00a0to operate services to the EU because Liberia is unable to ensure that its airlines meet international safety standards. There are no commercial operators of domestic flights within Liberia. Some airlines have suspended international flights into/out of Liberia.</p>\n\n<p>Keep up to date with real-time information from your airline, tour operator or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and Sea Travel</h3>\n<p>Liberia has many attractive beaches, but the Atlantic Ocean is subject to rip tides and other dangerous currents. Swimmers should take care and seek local advice before entering the water. Avoid canoes and fishing boats offering passenger services. They are regularly overwhelmed by strong waves and currents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n\n<p>Liberia has become increasing stable since the internal conflict ended in 2003.

If you wish to travel, you should contact your airline or travel agent for confirmation of flight schedules.</p>\n\n<p>Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) are closed to travellers. Ports remain open.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"testing--screening-on-arrival\">Testing / screening on arrival</h3>\n<p>All travellers arriving in Liberia will be screened for the coronavirus.  On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. If you display symptoms of coronavirus, public health officials may take you to a quarantine facility.  In Roberts International Airport, you must stand in marked spaces within the terminal to allow for social distancing.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers entering Liberia have two options for COVID-19 testing. Government of Liberia strongly encourages travellers to be tested before arrival in Liberia. You can have a COVID-19 PCR test at your point of departure within 72 hours before your arrival in Liberia. If you present a negative PCR test result on arrival in Liberia, you will be allowed entry with symptom monitoring via USSD or mobile app.</p>\n\n<p>You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not do a pre-departure PCR test before your arrival in Liberia, you will be tested on arrival. You will have to do a Rapid Test, and a swab will be collected for PCR test processing. If your Rapid Test result is negative, you will be allowed entry with symptom monitoring via USSD or mobile app.</p>\n\n<p>If your Rapid Test result is positive, you will be taken to a government quarantine facility pending your PCR test result. Sample processing could take several days. If your subsequent PCR result is positive you must remain in government quarantine. It is likely you will have to remain in quarantine until you have two consecutive negative PCR results. Quarantine may last 14 days or longer.</p>\n\n<p>You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and precautionary observation requirements with no advance notice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quarantine\">Quarantine</h3>\n<p>There is a high risk for British nationals of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian Precautionary Observation Centre (POCs) are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.</p>\n\n<p>You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Liberia, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>All foreign citizens in quarantine or self-isolation will have their passports removed and held by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) for 14 days. You will be given a copy of your passport to retain whilst in quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to quarantine or a government treatment centre</p>\n\n<p>Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in 14 days of quarantine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"leaving-liberia\">Leaving Liberia</h3>\n\n<p>Before departure from Liberia, you\u2019ll need a negative COVID-19 test result, and a travel certificate issued by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/national-public-health-institute-of-liberia-nphil/travel-application-procedures/3691547654208248/\">National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL)</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You must go to an NPHIL COVID-19 sample collection site at least 72 hours before your travel date, to give a sample for PCR testing.
