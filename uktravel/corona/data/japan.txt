It is generally safe to walk about at night and to travel on public transport, but you should maintain the same level of vigilance as you would at home and take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are rare, but do happen. Japanese law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual and committed through assault, intimidation or force. Reports of inappropriate touching or \u2018chikan\u2019 of female passengers on commuter trains are fairly common. The police advise that you shout at the perpetrator to attract attention and ask a fellow passenger to call the train staff.</p>\n\n<p>If your passport is lost or stolen, you should report this at a police station and get a police report.</p>\n\n<p>Tokyo\u2019s entertainment districts, like Roppongi and Kabuki-cho (near Shinjuku station), are considered higher risk areas for crime, in particular at night. There are reports of foreign nationals being targeted for drink-spiking, credit card fraud, extortion, robbery, assault and sexual assault in clubs and bars.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been reports of drink spiking or deliberately giving customers drinks with much higher levels of alcohol than would be expected. Victims have described waking up, often in an unknown location, with no memory of the preceding hours and finding out that large amounts have been billed to their credit card.</p>\n\n<p>Getting a police report, which may be required by credit card companies in order for any claim to be processed, can be very difficult in these circumstances. Make sure anything you drink can\u2019t be tampered with. Be wary of accepting drinks from strangers and always have a trusted friend to keep an eye on any unfinished drink if you need to leave it for a period of time.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals have been arrested following disputes with bar staff and doormen. including for refusing to pay exorbitant bar bills.</p>\n\n<p>Prostitution and street touts are illegal but commonplace. Don\u2019t accompany touts to bars and clubs under any circumstances. To encourage people into establishments, touts commonly misrepresent the services on offer, and/or wrongly suggest clients are free to walk away on arrival if they don\u2019t wish to proceed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"emergency-services\">Emergency services</h3>\n<p>In cases of emergency, dial 110 for the police and 119 for the fire or ambulance services. \u00a0Calls are free of charge from any phone, including pay phones. Hospitals may want to confirm you have insurance or means of payment before accepting you as a patient.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fukushima\">Fukushima</h3>\n\n<p>There are some exclusion zones around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, which are clearly <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/roadmap/\">identified by the Japanese authorities</a>. These exclusion zones are kept under review and have reduced in area over the past 5 years. Areas where evacuation orders are ready to be lifted (marked green on the map) are still subject to some restrictions - for instance visitors aren\u2019t allowed to stay overnight. Follow local guidance.</p>\n\n<p>The exclusion zone around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant has been designated a restricted area.</p>\n\n<p>The Japanese authorities are carrying out comprehensive checks to monitor radiation in the area surrounding Fukushima and to monitor possible contamination of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://radioactivity.nsr.go.jp/en/\">water,</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.maff.go.jp/e/quake/press_110312-1.html\">food and produce.</a> They impose strict controls where necessary. These reports are being monitored by UK government scientists. Any significant change in the current situation will be reported on this page.</p>\n\n<p>Although the situation at Fukushima will remain of concern for some time, the risks are gradually declining.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>To drive in Japan, you must hold an International Driving Permit (IDP), a current UK licence and insurance. An IDP is only valid for use in Japan for one year regardless of its date of expiry. Check the Tokyo <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.jp/multilingual/english/index.html\">Metropolitan Police Department</a>\u00a0website for further details. You must carry your driving licence with you at all times. Penalties for driving in Japan without the correct documents are severe.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to stay in Japan for longer than one year, you should apply for a Japanese driving licence. For more information and details of offices where you can apply for a Japanese licence, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/e/\">Japanese Automobile Federation</a>\u00a0website</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of driving insurance available in Japan: compulsory insurance (jibaisekihoken) and voluntary insurance (nin\u2019i no jidoshahoken). The compulsory insurance on its own may be insufficient in cases of personal liability.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are well maintained. Driving is on the left, as in the UK. Road rules are mostly the same as in the UK, but drivers should pay particular attention to: pedestrians crossing roads at green lights, especially at junctions; cyclists travelling on the pavements or on the wrong side of the road and without lights at night; and taxi drivers stopping suddenly.</p>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties to deter drink driving, including allowing someone else to drink and drive (for example if you are a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a drunk driver). Legal limits are lower than they are in the UK and offences can attract a heavy fine or imprisonment.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 3,920 road deaths in Japan (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 3.1 road deaths per 100,000 of population of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Japan is a stable democracy. Civil disturbances and violent demonstrations are rare. Occasionally, demonstrations of a pro-nationalist kind can involve hostility to foreign countries. Keep yourself informed of developments and if you become aware of any protests, leave the area immediately.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-phone-networks\">Mobile phone networks</h3>\n\n<p>Only 3G and 4G capable UK handsets will work in Japan. GSM-only UK phones don\u2019t work, as there\u2019s no GSM network. If you plan to make lots of calls or use mobile data in Japan, SIM cards are available to hire online or in-store. WiFi zones are also increasingly available in coffee shops, hotels and other public spaces.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in Japan, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>You must carry your passport or residence card at all times. Information about the residence card system can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/\">Japanese immigration website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for most offences tend to be more severe than in the UK. Detention, including for minor offences, is generally longer than in the UK and prison regimes in Japan are very strict.</p>\n\n<p>Police have the power to detain people whilst they investigate you, for up to 23 days, even for minor offences. If you are arrested, the police can question you before you are able to speak to a lawyer or an embassy consular officer. Investigations are not usually recorded and lawyers are not present. High quality interpretation may not always be available.</p>\n\n<p>If you are charged with a crime, it is likely that you will be detained without bail until your court dates. You may be subject to a communications ban if the charges are drug related, which means you will only be allowed to speak to your lawyer and embassy while awaiting trial. Legal proceedings can take many months or longer. More information about what happens if you are arrested can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/japan-prisoner-pack\">Japan Prisoner Pack</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most Japanese people are very friendly and welcoming but can be reserved. Loud, boisterous behaviour is not as acceptable as it is in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>In regard to sexual conduct in private, Japan is a tolerant society. However, public displays of affection are less common than in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not illegal, although currently there are no provisions in Japanese legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. While same-sex marriages are not recognised in Japan, some areas of the country have begun issuing equivalent certificates that can be used in civil issues, such as hospital visitation rights. Nichome in Tokyo and Doyamacho in Osaka are the most well-known LGBT areas. The Tokyo Rainbow Pride parade has been held without incident since 2012. In 2019, 10,000 people joined the parade and over 200,000 people took part in the two-day event. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Drinks and meals are paid for at the end of your visit to a Japanese bar. Tipping is not necessary. In some places, prices can be high. Disputes over bills can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<p>Tattoos in Japan have a historical association with organised crime, and while attitudes towards them are increasingly accepting, many public swimming pools, hot springs, beaches, and some gyms do not admit anyone with tattoos.  Other establishments may simply ask that any tattoos to be covered up while using the facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Whale meat is available in Japan but importing it into the UK/EU is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Any importation of whale meat into the UK will result in seizure of the goods, possibly a fine of up to \u00a35,000 and a custodial sentence.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s forbidden by Japanese law to bring meat products (including sausages, bacon and ham) into Japan without permission from the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service. As of April 2019, penalties are imposed on offenders bringing meat product illegally into Japan. For more information on illegal products, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.maff.go.jp/aqs/english/product/import.html\">Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Japanese family law is very different from UK law. For example, joint custody of a child after divorce is not a legal option, and access for a non-custodial parent can be challenging. Japan is party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which entered into force in Japan in April 2014. New Japanese legislation to strengthen enforcement of Hague Convention rulings came in to force from April 2020.  We have produced some general information about issues around custody, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/japan-child-abduction\">child abduction</a> and parental rights.</p>\n\n<p>The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines are banned under Japan\u2019s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law and ignorance may not be considered a defence. This includes Vicks Inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences. If you\u2019re travelling to Japan with medication, or are in Japan and intending to import medication into the country for personal use, you should check the status of your medicine with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate beforehand. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/japan/entry-requirements\">Medication</a></p>\n\n<p>Japan has a zero tolerance towards drug crime and there are severe penalties for all drug offences. Detection facilities at airports and post offices are effective. British nationals have been arrested and detained for receiving small quantities of cannabis through the mail, and for returning positive results in tests carried out by Japanese police on customers in bars. British nationals have received sentences for drug trafficking ranging from 6 to 17 years with work, or even longer, as well as receiving large fines. Prisoners in Japan are expected to work as part of their sentence.</p>\n", "slug": "local-laws-and-customs", "title": "Local laws and customs"}, {"body": "<p>The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government\u2019s understanding of the rules currently in place.

You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Medical facilities are good, but the cost of treatment is high. Hospitals and clinics are well equipped and staff highly trained. There are very few British doctors practising in Japan, but some Japanese doctors may speak English. You will be expected to pay the whole cost of any treatment you receive and there have been cases where treatment has been delayed whilst medical facilities check the legitimacy of the insurance. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance that covers pre-existing conditions and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>Residents in Japan will be required to enrol in either Employee or National Health Insurance.</p>\n", "slug": "health", "title": "Health"}, {"body": "<p>Japan is vulnerable to natural disasters because of its climate and topography.</p>\n\n<p>You should make yourself familiar with local procedures and preparations for natural disasters.
