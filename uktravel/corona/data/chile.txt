Only Chilean nationals and residents can enter the country, but it is still possible for foreign nationals to leave Chile. However, if you can prove family connections with Chileans or foreigners resident in Chile, you can contact the nearest Chilean Consulate to request a \u2018special permit to entry\u2019 (Salvoconducto) prior to your travel.</p>\n\n<p>The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Chilean authorities and other governments to make sure options remain available for you to return to the UK.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently listed commercial options to return to the UK from Chile, via the US, Brazil, Spain, France and Holland.  All flights could be subject to last minute change or cancellation.

New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards.</p>\n\n<p>On 28 July, as part of the Chilean government\u2019s step-by-step, five stage plan for the parts of Chile under quarantine orders to emerge in a phased manner from lockdown, comunas across Chile began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into later stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; prohibition of movement to secondary home. This remains the status for much of the country.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays; social gatherings of no more than 10 people allowed; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Preparation. Under this stage there will be no more mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 50 people; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 50 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and caf\u00e9s allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments (Education Ministry plans and health situation permitting). Curfew and cordon sanitaire dependent on local authority decision; social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75\u2019s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Re-opening of borders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed.</p>\n\n<p>The Government\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.chileatiende.gob.cl/coronavirus/cuarentena\">\u201cChile Atiende\u201d website</a> outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is in under the first heading (\u201cEn qu\u00e9 lugares de Chile hay cuarantena?\u201d).</p>\n\n<p>In areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services.

Be aware of your surroundings in and around the airport, when driving away and on arrival at your destination. In case of an incident, do not offer resistance.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of incidents in major cities where those driving rental cars have been victims of crime.  The perpetrators puncture the car\u2019s tyres surreptitiously (often while at traffic lights) and then target the vehicle when the occupants notice the flat tyre.  Often the victims do not notice the theft is taking place as an accomplice will distract while another steals valuables from the vehicle. Remain vigilant and keep valuables secure in this event. Other incidents include the interception of locking cars when drivers remotely activate the lock. Always double check that the car is locked.</p>\n\n<p>Pick pocketing and muggings are common in many cities throughout Chile, particularly around well-known tourist sites including airports, bus stations, ports and popular areas visited by foreigners. Pay particular attention to your belongings in popular foreign cafes and restaurants where there has been an increase in bag theft. There have been reports of violent muggings in areas popular with tourists in Santiago and Valparaiso. Be vigilant, particularly if you are in public places popular among tourists or near official buildings. Avoid carrying large amounts of money, passport (a photocopy is sufficient if needed), wearing valuable watches or jewellery or using your mobile phone while walking on the streets. Local authorities recommend not to resist muggers.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid puting any valuables in the storage compartments of buses and coaches - keep them with you at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Book a taxi in advance rather than hailing one from the street, especially late at night.

Most minefields are near the borders with Peru and Bolivia in the extreme north of Chile (regions XV, I and II) and Argentina in the south (region XII). Although most minefields are clearly marked, some signs and fences are old and damaged, and may be hard to spot. In some cases, minefields are laid right up to the edge of highways. Check with local authorities before travelling to more rural areas, stick to clearly marked roads and observe all warning signs.</p>\n\n<p>If travelling to national parks in Chile you are advised that open fires (outside permitted camping areas) are strictly forbidden. Local authorities may revoke tourist permits from anyone caught starting a fire within a Chilean National Park and ask  them to leave Chile voluntarily within 72 hours or face deportation. Additionally, if the open fire results in a larger forest fire, there may also be criminal penalties and fines.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to go exploring or mountaineering, notify the local authorities before you set off.

Chileans will go the polls to vote on a new Constitution on 25 October. There remains a high likelihood of protests \u2013 with potential for accompanying violence \u2013 on, and around, 18 and 25 October.  Please follow local guidance and avoid areas of protest.</p>\n\n<p>October and November 2019 saw large-scale protests and violence across Chile. Major protests were widely expected to return in March 2020, but incidents were limited, likely owing to the health crisis. Starting in April there were occasional cases of violence and protest in Santiago and other cities. Since July protests and violence have increased in Santiago, with various incidents having occurred, including the use of projectiles against police, flaming barricades, an arsonist attack on a metro station, and the burning of buses by small groups of protesters.</p>\n\n<p>Other cities, including Concepci\u00f3n, Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Valpara\u00edso, and Osorno have also seen sporadic incidents over the past few months.  Some protests have seen isolated incidents of the use of small arms by members of the public. If protests take place, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/chile/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a></p>\n\n<p>Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists including airports, bus stations and ports. Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/chile/safety-and-security\">Crime</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Chile can\u2019t be ruled out.
