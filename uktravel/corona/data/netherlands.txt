This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to family members or other people that you live with and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave.

Pick-pocketing and bag snatching are common. Thieves often operate in gangs on the trains to and from Schiphol airport and Central Station as well as on the trams. One thief will attempt to distract you (often by asking for directions or by banging on your window) while another picks your pocket or steals your bag. Be alert and don\u2019t lose sight of your luggage or your belongings. Sleeping passengers make particularly easy targets.</p>\n\n<p>Opportunist thieves are widespread and can enter restaurants with the excuse of selling you something or looking for someone. Bags have been stolen from between people\u2019s feet whilst they were distracted. Keep your valuables safely with you at all times and don\u2019t leave bags or jackets hanging on the back of a chair.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the victim of a theft contact the nearest police station and get a police report. Amsterdam Police have warned of criminals\u00a0using false police identities and tricking tourists into handing over cash and credit cards on the pretext of investigations into counterfeit money and false credit cards. Be very cautious about any such approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Genuine plain clothes police will rarely carry out this type of inspection. Always ask for identity, check it thoroughly and don\u2019t let yourself be intimidated. Dutch police don\u2019t have shiny badges, which the fake police sometimes present as ID. Call 0900-8844 to get in touch with the nearest police station if you are not entirely happy.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid confrontation with anyone offering you drugs of any sort and stay away from quiet or dark alleys - particularly late at night. \u00a0Even if you are tempted to buy, you risk arrest for doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Young women and those not in groups should be aware of the possibility of drinks being spiked. Don\u2019t leave your drink unattended. \u00a0If you believe you have been the victim of a spiked drink, seek medical help immediately and, if possible, inform the police.

Overhead illuminated lane indicators - when in use - are mandatory.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You must use dipped lights after dark and in misty conditions. If safety belts are fitted, they must be used. You must carry a warning triangle and, in the event of a breakdown, place it 30m behind your vehicle.
