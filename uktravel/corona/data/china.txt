You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19.

You should take reasonable precautions - don\u2019t leave drinks unattended and avoid accepting drinks from strangers. Women, travelling alone or with female friends, could be at greater risk - see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Serious crime against foreigners is relatively rare, but incidents do occur and less serious crime is not unusual. You should take care of your belongings at major tourist sites and other busy places, particularly where foreigners gather. If your passport is lost or stolen, you will need to go to the nearest police station or Public Security Bureau and get a report of the incident.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling in unmarked or unmetered taxis, as there have been incidents of sexual assault and robbery against foreigners. In marked taxis, make sure someone knows where you are and try to take a note of the taxi\u2019s number.</p>\n\n<p>Disputes over taxi fares can occur. Insist on paying the metered fare and ask for a receipt; this has the taxi number on it.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t hike alone in isolated areas, including on the Great Wall. If you do, always leave your itinerary, mobile number and expected time of return at your hotel or with a third party.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of attack from armed criminals in remote areas. The areas bordering on Siberia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Laos and Burma are poorly policed. In Yunnan Province, drug smuggling and other crimes are increasing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Beware of scams in popular tourist areas. A common example is the \u2018tea tasting\u2019 scam or \u2018massage\u2019 scam. You may be invited to visit a bar, to participate in tea tasting or for a massage, but then face demands for an exorbitant fee. This can be followed by threats or actual violence, and credit card fraud.</p>\n\n<p>Check QR code stickers on rental bicycles carefully before using them. There have been cases of the legitimate barcode being replaced with a false code, which redirects money to a different account.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"commercial-disputes\">Commercial disputes</h2>\n<p>Before entering into a contract in China you should take legal advice, both in the United Kingdom and in China. Contracts entered into in the United Kingdom are not always enforced by Chinese courts.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in or connected to a business and/or civil dispute, the Chinese authorities may prohibit you from leaving China until the matter is resolved. This is known as a travel ban. For more detailed advice on business risks and commercial disputes, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/commercial-disputes-in-china\">our guide on commercial disputes in China</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of British nationals being detained against their will to extort money or intimidate them have occurred. It is rare for violence to be used, but the threat of violence is a recurring theme. You should report any threats of violence to the Chinese police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"tibet-and-the-tibet-autonomous-region-tar\">Tibet and the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR)</h3>\n\n<p>You can only travel to the TAR on an organised tour and you must get a permit first, through a specialised travel agent in China. Chinese authorities sometimes stop issuing these without notice, and also restrict travel to Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures in neighbouring Provinces, even if you have a permit.  You should check with tour operators or travel agents and monitor this travel advice and other media for information.</p>\n\n<p>Once in Tibet you should avoid demonstrations and other large public gatherings. Ongoing political and ethnic tensions can lead to unrest and protest, sometimes violent. Security measures will be tight and unauthorised gatherings may be dispersed by force. Don\u2019t film or photograph any such activities or outbreaks of violence. Local authorities will react negatively if you\u2019re found carrying letters or packages from Tibetan nationals to be posted in other countries.</p>\n\n<p>Photography in Buddhist monasteries requires permission and carries a fee.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that the ability of the British Embassy Beijing and British Consulates in China to provide consular support in the Tibet Autonomous Region is limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"xinjiang-uyghur-autonomous-region\">Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region</h3>\n\n<p>The security situation in Xinjiang remains fragile, and conditions locally can deteriorate rapidly at short notice. There have been instances of violent unrest in Xinjiang, causing deaths. There have been allegations of the use of lethal force to disperse protests. The risk of terrorism is higher in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region than in other regions of China. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possibility of being caught up in any unexpected demonstrations or outbreaks of violence. The Chinese authorities will increase the security presence in the area and tend to react quickly and harshly to these incidents. The Chinese authorities may restrict travel to some areas of Xinjiang, particularly during religious festivals and after violent attacks.</p>\n\n<p>There have been widespread reports of arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial detention in Xinjiang, mainly affecting the local population, particularly Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. You may be at increased risk if you\u2019re of Uyghur descent and/or have lived previously in Xinjiang; or if you appear to be Muslim.</p>\n\n<p>You should expect airport-style security measures, including passport and security checks, at entrances to public places such as shopping centres, markets and parks. You may be required to inform the security forces of your phone number, have your photograph taken, or be questioned as to the nature of your travel.</p>\n\n<p>Carry your passport at all times, avoid all protests and large crowds, be vigilant and monitor media reports. Do not photograph or film protests, large crowds, security officials or installations, or anything of a military nature.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that the ability of the British Embassy Beijing and British Consulates in China to provide consular support in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is limited.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"building-safety\">Building safety</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"fire-precautions\">Fire precautions\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Fire protection standards in Chinese accommodation are not always the same as in the UK. Check fire precautions including access to fire exits. Make sure your accommodation has a working fire alarm and regularly check that the fire exits aren\u2019t blocked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"carbon-monoxide-poisoning\">Carbon monoxide poisoning</h3>\n<p>Make sure your accommodation has a working carbon monoxide alarm. There have been incidences of carbon monoxide poisoning and death due to incorrectly installed gas equipment. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.co-bealarmed.co.uk/how-to-stay-safe/\">\u2018Be Alarmed\u2019 campaign</a> gives practical advice on how to stay safe, and lists the symptoms to look out for.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>There are significant travel restrictions in China due to the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/coronavirus\">Coronavirus</a></p>\n\n<p>You need a Chinese driving licence to drive in China. You must also have valid insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Accidents are common in China due to the poor quality of roads, high volumes of traffic and generally low driving standards, so you should drive with caution. If you\u2019re involved in a serious traffic accident, call the police. Don\u2019t move your vehicle until they arrive but make sure you and your passengers are in a safe place. In cases where there are injuries, you may be held liable for medical costs. You will also be held liable if you run over a pedestrian.</p>\n\n<p>There are harsh penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol, even at very low levels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n<p>Mariners should avoid the disputed territory between China and other countries in the East China Sea. There have also been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in the area. See the Regional Co-operation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia Information Sharing <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.recaap.org\">website</a> for further information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n<p>You should be aware that there are significant travel restrictions in China due to the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Train services are operating at reduced levels and train stations are conducting temperature checks of incoming passengers.</p>\n\n<p>You will need to produce your passport to buy a ticket and again to board the train.</p>\n\n<p>Trans-Mongolian express trains (Beijing-Moscow via Ulaanbaatar) are noted for smuggling. Search your compartment and secure the cabin door before departure.</p>\n\n<p>Petty theft from overnight trains is common.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>China is a one-party state. Though China is very open to foreign visitors, you should be aware of political and cultural sensitivities in conversation with Chinese people.</p>\n\n<p>Territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries  have caused high regional tension. There have been a number of anti-Japanese and anti-Korean demonstrations in several cities across China. These protests have generally taken place outside diplomatic missions, but some have targeted other Japanese and Korean interests.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings. The Chinese authorities enforce public order strictly and you may face arrest, detention and/or deportation. Foreign journalists have been intimidated, assaulted or detained for trying to report demonstrations. You may also risk becoming a target yourself when general anti-foreign sentiment runs high. Keep yourself informed of developments and follow the advice of the local authorities. During periods of tension, some news reporting, access to text-messaging, the internet and to international telephone lines may be blocked.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Since early 2014, a number of explosions and knife attacks have occurred in public places, including in busy railway stations, resulting in injuries and fatalities. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. According to the Chinese government, most attacks are carried out by Uyghur separatists with possible links to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<h3 id=\"id\">ID</h3>\n<p>Carry your passport with you at all times. Police carry out random checks, especially during periods of heightened security and major sporting or political events. Failure to produce your ID can lead to a fine or detention. If you renew your passport while you\u2019re in China, you must register your new passport with the authorities promptly or face a fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"activities\">Activities</h3>\n<p>Certain behaviour may be deemed sensitive and attract greater scrutiny from the authorities, including photography near sensitive sites, engaging with political groups or charities, and making statements deemed politically sensitive. China\u2019s authorities have under certain circumstances detained foreigners citing \u2018endangering national security\u2019. National Security is interpreted broadly and you may be detained without having intended to break the law. There is also a risk of arbitrary detention, including of British Nationals.</p>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on certain religious activities, including preaching and distributing religious materials. The Falun Gong movement is banned in China.</p>\n\n<p>Gambling is illegal in mainland China.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-proceedings\">Criminal proceedings</h3>\n<p>Chinese laws and procedures relating to the arrest and detention of suspects of crime are different from in the UK. If you\u2019re suspected of a crime, the Chinese authorities have the power to prevent you from leaving China (by withholding your passport or applying a travel ban) or to detain you for up to 37 days without charge. Travel bans may also be imposed on individuals involved in commercial or private disputes. If you\u2019re detained on grounds of national security, which is interpreted more broadly than in the UK, you may be detained for up to 6 months before formal arrest and may be denied legal representation before charges are brought.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n<p>There are extremely severe penalties for drugs offences in China, including the death penalty. The Chinese authorities undertake random drug testing on foreign nationals including on entry to the country. If you test positive, the Chinese authorities can prosecute you regardless of where or when you consumed drugs. Police raids on homes also occur; if drugs are found in your property, penalties can be extremely severe.</p>\n\n<p>There have been increasing incidences of police raids on nightclubs and bars. When such raids take place, patrons will be subject to on the spot drug testing and immigration checks. This may involve being kept at the location, or a secondary location, for several hours whilst hair and urine samples are taken and passport and visa checks conducted. Testing positive to drugs, or being found in breach of your visa conditions, can lead to heavy fines, detention and deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h3>\n<p>China doesn\u2019t recognise dual nationality. If you enter China on a Chinese passport or identity card, the British Embassy may not be able to offer you help. If you were born in China to a Chinese national parent you will be considered by the Chinese authorities to have Chinese nationality, and may be treated as a Chinese citizen, even if you used a British passport to enter China. If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry clear evidence that you have done so.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cyber\">Cyber</h3>\n<p>The Chinese authorities maintain controls on internet access. Some services, including Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are permanently blocked. Other websites may be blocked from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>China\u2019s cyber security laws are changing and online products and services (eg VPNs) are required to be licensed by the Chinese government. More information is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.miit.gov.cn/\">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a> website (in Mandarin only). Make sure you stay informed and follow Chinese law.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT</h3>\n<p>Although homosexuality is not prohibited by law, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and public displays of affection may attract negative attention. There\u2019s no provision under Chinese legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. You can find information on LGBT life in China on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/living-in-china#lgbt-rights\">British Embassy website</a>.

Holders of expired residence permits can apply for a new one. You should check the eligibility of your visa with a Chinese Embassy or Consulate in the UK before booking travel.</p>\n\n<p>From 21 August, if you\u2019re travelling from the UK to China you will also need to submit a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate in the UK before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinese Embassy/Consulate will certify your form and return it to you via email.

This has changed from 5 days.</p>\n\n<p>You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinese authorities have specified a \u2018nucleic acid\u2019 test which they have explained is the standard test for COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>A limited number of international flights are flying into Beijing.

Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province.</p>\n\n<p>Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will be required to go into a government quarantine hospital.</p>\n\n<p>For all quarantine arrangements in China:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Unless directed by the authorities you are not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you are also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine</li>\n  <li>Depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi.</li>\n  <li>During your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room</li>\n  <li>If meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside.</li>\n  <li>Larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms.</li>\n  <li>If you\u2019re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication.

Don\u2019t overstay your visa or work illegally.

You may be required to show a police report indicating how you lost your full passport.</p>\n\n<p>If your ETD has been issued in China, you will need an exit visa from the Public Security Bureau before you can leave. This process can take up to 7 working days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-with-the-chinese-authorities\">Registering with the Chinese authorities</h3>\n<p>You must register your place of residence with the local Public Security Bureau within 24 hours of arrival. Chinese authorities enforce this requirement with regular spot-checks of foreigners\u2019 documentation. If you\u2019re staying in a hotel, they will do this for you as part of the check-in process.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"working-in-china\">Working in China</h3>\n<p>You can only work in China if you have a Z visa - tourist and business visit visas don\u2019t allow you to do so. You must also hold a valid work permit. The local police regularly carry out checks on companies/schools. Violation of Chinese immigration laws can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment, fines, deportation, a travel ban preventing you from leaving China, and an exclusion order, which prevents you from returning.</p>\n\n<p>Before you leave the UK you should contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/\">Chinese Embassy</a> to check visa requirements. When submitting your visa application, and when you receive your work permit, check that the details are correct, including the location you\u2019ll be working in. If they\u2019re not, you can be detained.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to change employer once you\u2019re in China, you should check with the Chinese authorities whether a new visa and work permit is required before doing so.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"teaching-in-china\">Teaching in China</h3>\n<p>Teaching in China can be a rewarding experience, but before you travel it\u2019s important that you research thoroughly the school or university that is hiring you and are confident that they are following the law.

Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"healthcare\">Healthcare</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re on prescription medication, make sure you bring enough with you or have access to a supply in China. Certain medicines may not be available and you <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/medicines-abroad/\">may be prohibited</a> from bringing others into the country. For more information and advice, check with your GP and the Embassy of China before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Healthcare is not free in China and can be very expensive. Make sure you have comprehensive travel and medical insurance covering healthcare and medical evacuation/repatriation for the duration of your stay. For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-treatment-in-china\">Medical treatment in China</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 120 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you need treatment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>The high levels of air pollution in major urban and industrialised areas in China may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the pollution index levels for Beijing and other cities on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aqicn.info/city/beijing/\">Air Quality Index website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Tap water in China is generally not safe to drink. You should drink only bottled water.</p>\n\n<p>The extreme altitude (over 3,000m) of some areas, including Tibet, parts of Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province, may cause altitude sickness.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinese authorities react quickly to any outbreaks of any infectious disease, including enforcing quarantine for those showing symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>On 23 May 2018 the US Consulate in Guangzhou issued a health alert following a recent report of abnormal symptoms by a US government employee based in Guangzhou. The British Embassy is seeking further information but at this stage is not aware of any specific risks to British nationals. If you have any concerns about symptoms or medical problems, you should always seek medical advice.</p>\n\n<p>Human infections of avian influenza are being reported in China, particularly among those individuals who have been in close contact with infected birds. Before travelling, you should read more information and follow the prevention advice on <a href=\"/government/publications/avian-influenza-advice-for-travellers-to-china\">Public Health England</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china#Other_risks\">NaTHNaC\u2019s</a> websites.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/42/dengue\">Dengue fever</a> is present in some parts of China mainly during the rainy season.

See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>In light of protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong, there are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong. This includes reports that travellers\u2019 electronic devices have been checked at border crossings.

Although foreigners haven\u2019t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t attempt to travel to Tibet without getting the correct permits.
