On 1 March 2013 there was an exchange of fire and a number of fatalities. On 3 March 2013 there were reports of further incidents on the coast between Lahad Datu and Semporna. Additional Malaysian security forces were sent to the area on 4 March 2013 and on 5 March 2013 airstrikes and other military action was reported against locations held by the armed group from Sulu around Kampung Tanduo.</p>\n\n<p>The Malaysian authorities have designated the entire eastern portion of Sabah (extending from the town of Kudat in northern Sabah to Tawau district near the border with Indonesia) as the Eastern Sabah Security Zone, and established the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) to co-ordinate security forces\u2019 activity in the area. The Malaysian security forces have strengthened their presence in the area and introduced measures to reduce the risk of unauthorised boat landings.</p>\n\n<p>The local authorities have imposed restrictions on travel by water in some coastal districts of eastern Sabah and in the coastal waters off eastern Sabah, including a night-time curfew. For more information, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sabahtourism.com/advisory/\">Sabah Tourism website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from petty crime. Avoid carrying valuables and take particular care of your passport whilst walking, in aircraft, cafes, airport and railway terminals, and hotel rooms. Don\u2019t open your hotel room door to strangers, especially late at night. This applies particularly to women travelling alone. Credit card and ATM fraud is widespread. Take great care when using your card.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of bag snatching are common, particularly in major cities and including by thieves on motorbikes. Bags with shoulder straps should either be carried with the bag towards the pavement rather than the road, or tucked under the arm. Don\u2019t wrap the strap around your arm or shoulder and do not try to hold on to your bag. People have been injured or killed by being pulled to the ground by their bag straps.</p>\n\n<p>Taxi coupon systems are in place at airports. In other areas, taxis should use a meter.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful if you\u2019re offered a drink by a stranger, even in a reputable bar or restaurant. These approaches can involve spiked drinks, and have resulted in cases of robbery and assault.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a victim of crime, inform the local police and get a police report.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Malaysia with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> for up to one year from your date of entry into Malaysia. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>After a year, you will need to get a Malaysian driving licence. Further information is available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jpj.gov.my/en/web/main-site/utama\">Malaysian Road Transport Department</a>.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals already in possession of a Malaysian driving licence can continue to renew their Malaysian driving licence as before.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions in Peninsular Malaysia are generally good, but less so in East Malaysia. Vehicles (particularly motorcycles) don\u2019t always stop at traffic lights or pedestrian crossings. If you are involved in a road accident you are obliged by law to stay at the scene until the police have arrived. If a crowd gathers, it may be safer to leave the scene and report to the nearest police station.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of fatal bus crashes, particularly on overnight journeys.  Choose a reputable operator for your journey.</p>\n\n<p>If you rent a motorbike you should take the same safety precautions as in the UK. Malaysian law states that helmets must be worn.</p>\n\n<p>Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence and the traffic police regularly carry out breath tests.  Anyone over the legal limit can face a heavy fine and/or a jail sentence and deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h3>\n\n<p>Piracy in South East Asian waters is an ongoing problem. There have been a number of attacks against ships in and around Malaysian waters, particularly in the Strait of Malacca and the waters between Sabah and the southern Philippines.  Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions. Reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Some passenger boats have sunk due to overloading and/or poor maintenance. Take care at all times when travelling by passenger ferry or speedboat and avoid travelling on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-sports-and-scuba-diving\">Water sports and scuba diving</h3>\n\n<p>If you rent jet skis or any other type of water sports equipment, make sure adequate safety precautions are in place. Only use reputable licensed operators, insist on training before use and make sure you\u2019re insured.</p>\n\n<p>Check dive operators\u2019 credentials carefully and make sure you\u2019re insured. Check that safety equipment is available on the boat, including oxygen. Ask about contingency plans, which should include the ability to call for help while at sea and to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>You should take great care if you\u2019re diving the sites of HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales, which lie in international waters off Kuantan. They have been declared \u2018protected places\u2019 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. You should only dive there on a \u2018look not touch\u2019 basis. Don\u2019t attempt to penetrate the wrecks, which lie in deep water. A British diver died in November 2011 while diving on HMS Repulse. Make sure any boat operator you use holds a licence for diving at the wreck site.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n\n<p>Police have sometimes used tear gas and water cannons to control public protests.

There has also been a kidnapping case in Sandakan on mainland Sabah.</p>\n\n<p>The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), based in the Philippines, has previously kidnapped foreigners from the east coast of mainland Sabah, the islands and the surrounding waters. A number of hostages have been murdered by the group. Some groups operating in the southern Philippines, including ASG, have pledged allegiance to Daesh and are likely to regard Westerners as legitimate targets.  Commercial shipping companies have been advised to adopt heightened vigilance when navigating the Sulu and Celebes Sea.  Most maritime incidents occur in the Sulu Sea in the area between Sabah (Malaysia) and Mindanao, the Sulu Islands and Palawan (Philippines). Boats travelling to and from off-shore islands and dive sites are possible targets. The Malaysian authorities have increased security in the region in response to recent incidents.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>Malaysia is a multicultural, majority Muslim country.

Attacks could happen anywhere, including in places visited by foreigners. Be vigilant, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>In May 2017, the Philippines authorities reported that they had received unsubstantiated but credible information that the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf may be about to conduct kidnaps in the Sulu Sea, including around the islands of the Sulu archipelago (Philippines) and the seas/islands off the east coast of Sabah (Malaysia). Any vessels sailing in this area could be targeted. You should carefully consider travel plans and be especially vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat to foreigners of kidnapping and criminality on the eastern coast of Sabah and in particular the islands close to the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines. There has been an increase in kidnapping by groups operating in the southern Philippines, some of whom have the ability to conduct kidnaps on the coast of Sabah. Commercial shipping companies have been advised to adopt heightened vigilance when navigating the Sulu and Celebes Seas. Most maritime incidents occur in the Sulu Sea in the area between Sabah (Malaysia) and Mindanao, the Sulu Islands and Palawan (Philippines). The Regional Co-operation Agreement on Combatting Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.recaap.org/\">(ReCAAP)</a> advise all ships <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.recaap.org/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&amp;EntryId=463&amp;PortalId=0&amp;TabId=78\">to re-route from the area</a> where possible.</p>\n\n<p>You should take great care in the town of Sandakan and along the coastal area south to Tawau, and in and around Lahad Datu and Semporna. In May 2015, 2 Malaysian nationals were abducted in Sandakan, one of whom was subsequently murdered. Monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia/terrorism\">Terrorism</a> and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia/safety-and-security\">Local travel - Sabah</a></p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Malaysia as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/137/malaysia#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Malaysia is a multicultural, majority Muslim country. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a></p>\n\n<p>Around 360,000 British nationals visit Malaysia each year. Most visits are trouble free, but incidents of petty crime, especially bag snatching, can affect visitors. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia/safety-and-security\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>You can contact the emergency services by calling 999 (police and ambulance) or 994 (fire).</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.
