You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times.</li>\n  <li>Only six people can sit together at a restaurant, bar or caf\u00e9. These venues must close by midnight and from 6pm can only serve customers who are seated at a table.</li>\n  <li>Some regions have introduced nightly curfews or restrictions on movement; you should check regional websites to see if these will apply to you.</li>\n  <li>Seating will be preassigned within theatres, cinemas and concert venues and has been limited to permit social distancing.</li>\n  <li>Dance activity in nightclubs and open air venues has been suspended and parties are not permitted.</li>\n  <li>Museums and archaeological sites are open but entry must be pre-booked.</li>\n  <li>Parks are open and outdoor exercise is permitted, subject to social distancing.</li>\n  <li>Funerals are permitted to take place with limited attendance.

The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered.
