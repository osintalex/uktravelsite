Demonstrations, road blocks and protests have taken place across C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire since August, and have increased since the start of the election campaign (15 October 2020). Trees have been used to block roads, protesters are manning the road blocks and may obstruct passage.</p>\n\n<p>There have been outbreaks of violence (including between communities), which have caused a number of civilian deaths. In Dabou, there have been at least 16 deaths. A night time curfew is currently in place.</p>\n\n<p>You should exercise caution and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds, political gatherings and rallies, particularly on election day and following the announcement of the results. Crowds can gather quickly and road blocks are common. In the event of unrest, monitor local media and follow instructions and announcements from the local authorities. You should comply with any additional checks or security measures introduced by the authorities, which may be introduced at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Curfews may be put in place across the country at short notice in response to protests or violence. Further protests are highly likely in the run up to the Presidential election and in the aftermath, with the potential for violence.</p>\n\n<p>A reinforced police presence is likely to continue in Abidjan and nationally in the run up to the election.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant near military barracks, military installations, large crowds and demonstrations. There were several incidents of violence and protest related to the military during 2017 and 2018.</p>\n\n<p>The risk of a return to the levels of conflict experienced between December 2010 and May 2011 is low.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re staying longer in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire you should regularly review personal security arrangements and seek professional security advice. You should keep a stock of food and water.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a risk of crime in Abidjan, including violent crime, car-jackings, armed break-ins to private residences, hold-ups in the street, and theft from cars. These incidents aren\u2019t common, but they do occur.</p>\n\n<p>In vehicles, keep doors locked, windows shut and valuables out of sight. If possible, avoid using public transport, shared taxis, or walking around after dark.</p>\n\n<p>On bridges to and from the Le Plateau areas of Abidjan, pedestrians have been attacked and robbed even during the day. Avoid displaying your wallet; for instance, have money to hand to tip supermarket trolley attendants.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks by armed robbers have occurred on the main road between Yamoussoukro and Korogho.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks have been reported in the west of the country, during daylight hours as well as night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-border-with-mali-and-burkina-faso-including-como-national-park-area\">Northern border with Mali and Burkina Faso (including Como\u00e9 national park area)</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to within 40km of the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, due to the security situation in these neighbouring countries.

Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads and vehicles can be poorly lit, and unlit broken-down vehicles can block the road. You should be alert to the risk of stray livestock that could cause a safety hazard. Grass or leaves strewn on the carriageway often means an accident or other hazard in the road ahead. During the rainy season roads, especially those that are minor and unpaved, may become impassable.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor. Unskilled drivers, poorly maintained vehicles and overloaded vehicles and inadequate lighting make driving conditions hazardous. Taxis are available in main cities, but are likely to be  in bad mechanical condition. There\u2019s an online taxi booking service operated in Abidjan by Africab, whose service is becoming increasingly popular. Wear a seat belt at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks-and-checkpoints\">Roadblocks and checkpoints</h3>\n<p>You might still occasionally encounter checkpoints in and around Abidjan.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company.

Demonstrations, road blocks and protests have taken place across the country since the start of the election campaign on 15 October. Further protests are likely. You should avoid all demonstrations, large crowds and rallies, particularly on election day.

There is an increased risk of terrorism and kidnap in northern border areas, due to the porous nature of borders into the Sahel region. However, there remains a risk elsewhere in the country. Attacks on beach resorts, hotels, caf\u00e9s and restaurants visited by foreigners are possible and could occur without warning. Be especially vigilant in these places.
