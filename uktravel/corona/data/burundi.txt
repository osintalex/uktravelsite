Muggings at gun and knife point, bag snatching, pick-pocketing, burglary, car break-ins, and armed car hijackings have all been reported. Avoid walking in the streets or using public transport after dark, even in Bujumbura city centre, and don\u2019t carry large amounts of money. Take care when withdrawing or exchanging cash, and avoid doing so at night.</p>\n\n<p>Stay at hotels that have good security. Safeguard valuables and cash. Use hotel safes, where possible. Keep copies of important documents, including your passport and visa, separately. Be wary of who you plan to meet and where, and inform colleagues or family members of your plans.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>The security situation across Burundi remains volatile.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed incursions from eastern DRC into neighbouring border areas of Burundi.

Since July 2016, Burundi banned public transport vehicles from crossing the border with Rwanda and introduced restrictions on Burundian food products being exported into Rwanda.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Burundi on a full UK driving licence for the first 6 months after you arrive. You\u2019ll then need to get a Burundi driving licence. There are only a small number of tarmac roads and these are sometimes in poor condition. Driving standards are poor and there are frequent serious accidents. Keep car doors locked and windows closed when driving. Access in to and out of Bujumbura city is controlled by police at night.</p>\n\n<p>Road blocks and document checks are common, and not always official. Carry a copy of your passport and visa, but you may be required to produce the originals. Reports of attempted robberies at fake checkpoints have increased.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on collective and public transport (buses and motorbike taxis), due to poor vehicle maintenance and low driving standards.</p>\n\n<p>Road infrastructure is poor and roads are frequently blocked or damaged by landslides, especially after heavy rain. Landslides have destroyed road bridges, making some routes impassable. Check local advice on road conditions when planning travel by road and have a contingency plan in case your preferred route is blocked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>Commercial flights into and out of Bujumbura International Airport have been suspended.
