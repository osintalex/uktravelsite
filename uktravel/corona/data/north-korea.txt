Take sensible precautions to protect your belongings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fire-safety\">Fire safety</h3>\n<p>An incident at a hotel in Pyongyang in June 2015 highlighted a culture of low safety awareness. You may wish to check hotel fire procedures or consult your tour operator.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>Tourists can normally only travel to North Korea as part of an organised tour. Independent travellers will need a sponsor and permission from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This is normally only possible for business travellers.</p>\n\n<p>Travel within the country is severely restricted. Whether you are visiting on business or as a tourist, you will almost always be accompanied by a guide and will only be allowed to go where your guide is content for you to go. For travel outside Pyongyang, it is your guide\u2019s responsibility to get the necessary permissions. Military checkpoints at the entry and exit to all towns usually include ID checks.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 a South Korean tourist who strayed into a restricted military area was shot dead. Take care to remain in permitted areas and move away immediately if asked to do so by North Korean officials.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners living in Pyongyang are usually able to travel freely within the city, but permission is often required for travel outside Pyongyang.</p>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t enter or leave North Korea through the border with South Korea without special permission.  In response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the North Korean government announced that all air and train routes into and out of North Korea were temporarily suspended with effect from 31 January 2020.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Taxis are sometimes available from hotels or outside department stores, but they will be reluctant to take you without a local guide or interpreter. Public transport is not generally accessible to foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>International Driving Permits are not valid in North Korea. Foreigners living in North Korea must get a local driving licence by passing a local driving test. You should take extra care when driving, as roads are often of poor quality with frequent hazards, and pedestrian road safety awareness is low.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n<p>The domestic network is small, equipment is old and trains are subject to delays because of electricity shortages. There is a rail service between Pyongyang and Beijing via Sinuiju/Dandong (North Korean and Chinese border towns) 4 times a week, and a daily service between Pyongyang and Dandong. Facilities on board are basic.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>Most travellers enter North Korea on direct flights from Beijing to Pyongyang operated by Air Koryo, the North Korean national airline, or Air China.</p>\n\n<p>All aircraft operated by Air Koryo, with the exception of two Tupolev Tu204, have been <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm\">refused permission</a> to operate services to the EU because they do not meet international safety standards. Incidents reported in July 2016 and May 2017 involving Air Koryo flights highlight the lack of official information regarding Air Koryo\u2019s safety record and standards.</p>\n\n<p>Air Koryo is still used by some members of Pyongyang\u2019s international community, including businesspeople, diplomats and international organisations. Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office staff only use Air Koryo when it is operationally necessary and this position is kept under review.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Tensions increased throughout 2017 due to the number of missile launches carried out by DPRK and the threat of further missile or nuclear tests. There were two nuclear tests in 2016 and one in 2017, a series of ballistic missile tests in 2016 and 2017, one intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July 2017 and one in November 2017. On 21 April 2018, North Korea announced a halt to nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile testing,  but since May 2019, has carried out a number of other missile tests.  These include the testing of submarine launched and short range ballistic missiles, which DPRK tested most recently in March 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Since the start of 2018, there has been a renewed direct contact between the North and South Korean governments, and  North Korea and the United States. The two Koreas competed under a unified flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics, exchanged high-level delegations for the opening and closing ceremonies, and held 3 inter-Korean leaders\u2019 summits in April, May and September 2018. The Panmunjom Declaration, signed at the first summit, confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. Both countries also pledged to agree a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, alongside a number of other commitments to build inter-Korean ties, reduce military tensions and establish a peace regime.</p>\n\n<p>On 12 June 2018, US President Donald Trump met North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Their summit was the first ever meeting between a sitting US President and North Korean leader. In a joint statement, North Korea reaffirmed the commitment it made on 27 April to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. The US and North Korea also committed to establish new US-DPRK relations, to join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and those missing in action from the Korean War, and repatriate any remains already identified. The two leaders held a second summit in Hanoi on 27 to 28 February 2019.  The meeting broke up without agreement.  A further meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un took place on 30 June 2019 at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas, in which the two agreed that working-level negotiations would resume within weeks.  However, the level of tension on the Korean Peninsula can change with little notice. Tensions increased after the sinking of the South Korean Navy Ship Cheonan and an artillery attack against Yeonpyeong Island in 2010; when the DPRK carried out 2 missile tests in 2012; and after nuclear tests in 2013, 2016 and 2017. Tensions can also rise during the regular South Korean-US military exercises, which take place throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p>Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the Korean Peninsula has been divided by a demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the DPRK and the Republic of Korea. Peace has been maintained under an armistice agreement but no formal peace treaty has ever been signed. If you\u2019re in the area of the DMZ, you should exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in North Korea, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

He was alleged to have attempted to steal a political slogan from the staff quarters of a main tourist hotel. On 13 June 2017, he was released and returned to the US in a coma. He died on 19 June 2017.</p>\n\n<p>A Japanese national visiting North Korea as part of an organised tour group was detained on 5 August 2018 on unspecified grounds before being released and deported on 28 August 2018.</p>\n\n<p>In late June 2019, it was reported that an Australian national, living as a student in Pyongyang, had been detained. He was released and left North Korea on 4 July 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Although there\u2019s no specific legislation outlawing homosexuality in North Korea, same-sex relationships are considered unacceptable by the authorities.

They can only be used in North Korea by purchasing a North Korean SIM card.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid bringing books or other written material in the Korean language, including anything with religious content. Any literature deemed subversive or pornographic by the DPRK authorities risk being confiscated. There have been cases of travel guides being confiscated at the airport on arrival; they are usually returned on departure.</p>\n\n<p>Consider carefully any films or television programmes that you bring into the country, either on DVD or on data storage devices. Those deemed to have an anti-DPRK government message may be confiscated and you may face detention as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Tipping is officially frowned upon, but is increasingly expected by some hotel staff.</p>\n\n<p>Always carry some form of identification.

In a joint statement, North Korea reaffirmed its previous commitment to denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. The Panmunjom Declaration, signed at an inter-Korean summit on 27 April 2018,  included a number of commitments to build inter-Korean ties and reduce military tensions. A second summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, in Hanoi on 27 to 28 February 2019, ended without agreement.   A further meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un took place on 30 June 2019 at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas, in which the two agreed that working-level negotiations would resume within weeks.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, similar periods of diplomatic engagement have failed to be sustained. This has led to further missile or nuclear tests and a return to instability in the region. Tensions usually rise around the time of South Korean-US military exercises, notably those regularly held in spring and autumn.
