As a result, strict sanitary rules and restrictions are in place.</p>\n\n<p>Masks are compulsory in open public spaces across Poland, apart from parks, forests and National Parks. Children under 4 are not required to wear masks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a mask, you must carry a doctor\u2019s note with you explaining this. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person.</p>\n\n<p>You must also wear a mask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500/\u00a3100) if you are found not to be wearing a mask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 (\u00a36,000) for failing to follow sanitary rules.</p>\n\n<p>All children up to the age of 16 must remain at home between 8 am to 4 pm, unless accompanied by an adult.</p>\n\n<p>Seniors, aged 70 and over have been requested to stay at home, leaving only for work or necessities.</p>\n\n<p>Public gatherings are limited to 5 people in all of Poland, excluding households bigger than 5 members and workplaces. There are restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals. From 24 October there is a nationwide ban on weddings and wakes.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport is operating with 50% capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis. Masks must be worn at all times.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to visit a cultural or sports venue you should consult their website for information about opening. Many have information in English as well as Polish. National Forests, parks and beaches are open.</p>\n\n<p>Only five customers per till are permitted inside shops or one person per 15 square metres in large stores. This might mean you have to queue for entry. In all areas of Poland a mask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. \u2018Seniors only\u2019 hours are in place between 10 am to 12 noon on weekdays. These hours are in place in shops, pharmacies and post offices, and apply to those aged 60 and over.</p>\n\n<p>From 24 October restaurants, cafes and pubs will be closed, and can only provide a takeaway/delivery service. Hairdressers remain open by appointment only. Most museums, libraries and cultural venues are open with limited numbers and strict sanitary rules.</p>\n\n<p>Sporting events are not permitted with audiences, but may take place without an audience. Cultural events can take place with 25% audience capacity. If you have tickets for an event that may be affected check with event organisers for further information.</p>\n\n<p>Swimming pools, gyms, sanatoriums and aqua parks will be closed nationwide from 24 October. Indoor play centres, tanning salons, massage salons and tattoo parlours remain open, with strict hygiene rules in place including limits on numbers of people.</p>\n\n<p>For updates changes in restrictions see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MZ_GOV_PL\">Polish Ministry for Health\u2019s Twitter</a> pages (in Polish \u2013 look for the colour coded map).</p>\n\n<p>The above national measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice. In areas with high infection rates, the authorities may set further local restrictions at short notice resulting in further reductions in numbers of people permitted to enter a venue, or in some cases complete closure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-and-air-travel\">Road and air travel</h3>\n<p>You can enter and depart Poland by car or coach over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. Countries neighbouring Poland may introduce border restrictions at short notice.

Serious crime against foreigners is rare, but crimes do occur and in some cases attacks have been racially motivated. You should be alert to the possibility of street crime and petty theft, and that foreigners may appear to be easy targets. Keep valuables and cash out of sight, especially in crowded areas and tourist spots where pickpockets and bag snatchers operate.</p>\n\n<p>There is a higher risk of robbery at main rail stations and on all train services, especially overnight sleeper trains. You are most at risk while boarding and leaving trains.</p>\n\n<p>Unregulated taxi drivers operate at Warsaw airports and elsewhere. They often overcharge. Only use official taxis, which have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and on the top of the taxi. They will also show a rate card on the window of the vehicle.

You will be fined on the spot if you\u2019re travelling with an invalid ticket, usually 266PLN (around \u00a354). You can buy tickets at most newspaper stands and kiosks with a sign reading \u2018Bilety\u2019 or ticket machines found in cities.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you may qualify for a cheaper fare (e.g. you are a student or an older person) always double-check the rules as some cheaper fares may only be available to Polish nationals.
