Before travelling you should check the websites of the relevant state governments. Further information can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html\">CDC website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A number of US states have mandated the use of masks and face coverings while in public.

Contact details are found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories\">US.GOV site</a> .</p>\n\n<p>Further restrictions will vary locally with some states relaxing lockdown procedures while others are pausing or reversing their re-openings.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n<p>Hotels are re-opening across the USA but will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-places-and-services\">Public places and services</h2>\n<p>Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities will likely be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.

The USA doesn\u2019t issue IDPs to foreign visitors, so you\u2019ll need to get one before you travel.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Most visits are trouble free.</p>\n\n<p>There have been widespread protests across the USA since 27 May 2020, some of which have turned violent. Curfews have been enforced in many cities as a result. There is potential for further protests and curfews. You should follow the instructions of local authorities. If you do attend any peaceful protests, you should be mindful of your surroundings and move away if there are signs of trouble.</p>\n\n<p>Snow storms during winter can cause delays and cancellations throughout the major airline hubs in the USA.
