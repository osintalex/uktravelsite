The vast majority of visits are trouble-free, but you should take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Don\u2019t accept lifts from strangers. Use only licensed taxis or other recognized forms of public transport.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. UAE law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual, especially when the victim had consumed alcohol or where the alleged attacker was known to the victim. If the sexual relations are determined to have been consensual, both parties may face prosecution for the offence of sex outside marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone, and should use a reputable taxi company, particularly at night. Drink spiking can occur. Don\u2019t accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"beach-safety\">Beach safety</h2>\n\n<p>Rip currents can occur at any beach, and can sweep even the strongest swimmer out to sea. Always comply with warning signs, especially red flags, and only swim from approved beaches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting the UAE, you can drive a rental car using your UK driving licence. If you intend to drive a private vehicle as a visitor, you should check that you\u2019re covered under the vehicle\u2019s insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re applying for residence in the UAE, you can use your UK licence until your residence permit is issued, after which you\u2019ll need to immediately get a UAE driving licence from the traffic department.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards in the UAE are not always as disciplined as in the UK and there is a high rate of traffic accidents. The World Health Organisation has reported that UAE road users are almost 7 times more likely to be killed than their UK counterparts and that the UAE has one of the highest rates of road deaths. Speeding is common.</p>\n\n<p>It is a criminal offence in the UAE to drink and drive, no matter how small the amount. Your insurance is also likely to be invalidated in the event of an accident. Offensive gestures and bad language used at other drivers can lead to fines, a jail sentence, and possibly deportation. Flashing your lights in the UAE can mean a driver is coming through, rather than giving way.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident you should follow the rules of the Emirate in which you are travelling. In Abu Dhabi, if no one has been hurt and vehicle damage is minor, drivers should move vehicles to the side of the road to avoid blocking traffic; otherwise, the vehicles should not be moved. In Dubai, you should only move your vehicle if it is causing an obstruction to other motorists. In the other Emirates, you may only move your car if the accident is minor and both parties agree on who is responsible for it. In all cases, call the police. It is an offence to leave the scene of an accident before the police have arrived.</p>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert can be dangerous unless you\u2019re in a properly equipped 4 x 4 vehicle. Always travel in convoy with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone, and leave a copy of your travel plans with friends or relatives.</p>\n\n<p>Pedestrians should take great care. Only cross roads using designated pedestrian crossings, failure to comply can lead to prosecution. Vehicles often don\u2019t stop at zebra crossings marked on the roads.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected. Mariners should make careful enquiries before entering these waters.</p>\n\n<p>You should consider how regional tensions may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful when travelling by tourist boat. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available for all passengers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Events in the Middle East, including Iraq and the Middle East Peace Process, can affect local public opinion. Follow news reports and be alert to local and regional developments, which might trigger public disturbances.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2018, numerous missiles have been launched into Saudi Arabia from Yemen, including attacks on aviation interests. The vast majority of these have been intercepted and destroyed but there have been a small number of casualties. Claims have been made in public media suggesting that there may also be attempts to target missiles and unmanned aerial systems (drones) aimed at the UAE. In the event of any incidents, you should monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"qatar\">Qatar</h3>\n<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) authorities announced the suspension of diplomatic relations with Qatar in 2017. All air and sea points of entry between UAE and Qatar were closed on 6 June 2017. If you have a question about travel you should contact your airline or travel company. There are further restrictions on travel and residence affecting UAE and Qatar nationals.

You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with, and respect local laws and customs.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 24 April and finish on 23 May. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/travelling-during-ramadan\">Travelling during Ramadan</a></p>\n\n<p>You can read more about living in the UAE <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/living-in-the-united-arab-emirates#social-ethics-and-traditions-in-uae\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"importing-goods\">Importing goods</h3>\n<p>Importing pork products and pornography into the UAE is illegal. Videos, books, and magazines may be subject to scrutiny and may be censored.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drugs-related offences. The penalties for trafficking, smuggling and possession of drugs (even residual amounts) are severe. Sentences for drug trafficking can include the death penalty and possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can lead to a minimum 4-year jail sentence. The Emirati authorities count the presence of drugs in the blood stream as possession. Some herbal highs, like Spice, are illegal in the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>Many people stop off in UAE airports on their way to other destinations. UAE airports have excellent technology and security, so transiting passengers carrying even residual amounts of drugs may be arrested.</p>\n\n<p>Some skincare products and E-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in the UAE such as CBD oil. If found in possession of such products, they will be confiscated and you may face criminal charges. A list of narcotic, psychotropic and controlled drugs where this rule applies, allowed quantities and documents to present can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mohap.gov.ae/Files/MOH_Service/361/ANNEX%20TO%20TRAVELLERS%20GUIDELINES%2008-04-2019.pdf\">UAE Ministry of Health website</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n<p>Non-Muslim residents can get a liquor licence to drink alcohol at home and in licensed venues. These licences are valid only in the Emirate that issued the licence. Residents must also get a permit to be able to drink in licensed venues.</p>\n\n<p>In Dubai, tourists are able to obtain a temporary liquor licence for the duration of a month from the two official liquor distributors in Dubai. Tourists will be provided with a code of conduct document and will be asked to confirm they understand rules and regulations in relation to purchasing, transporting and consuming liquor in Dubai. This licence is only for use in the Emirate where it is issued.</p>\n\n<p>Liquor licences are not available to non-residents in the other Emirates, but it is possible for tourists and visitors to buy and drink alcohol in licensed venues, such as hotels, restaurants and clubs. However, you should be aware that it is a punishable offence under UAE law to drink or be under the influence of alcohol in public. British nationals have been arrested and charged under this law, often in cases where they have come to the attention of the police for a related offence or matter, such as disorderly or offensive behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, the legal age for drinking alcohol is 18 in Abu Dhabi, but a Ministry of Tourism by-law prevents hotels from serving alcohol to those under the age of 21. In Dubai and all other emirates besides Sharjah, the drinking age is 21. Drinking alcohol in Sharjah is illegal.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers in transit through the UAE under the influence of alcohol may also be arrested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Women should dress modestly when in public areas like shopping malls. Clothes should cover the tops of the arms and legs, and underwear should not be visible. Swimming attire should be worn only on beaches or at swimming pools.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-dressing is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hotels\">Hotels</h3>\n\n<p>It is normal practice for hotels to take a photocopy of your passport or Emirates ID. You can\u2019t stay in a hotel if you\u2019re under 18 years old and not accompanied by an adult.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"offensive-behaviour\">Offensive behaviour</h3>\n\n<p>Swearing and making rude gestures (including online) are considered obscene acts and offenders can be jailed or deported. Take particular care when dealing with the police and other officials.</p>\n\n<p>Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and there have been several arrests for kissing in public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-outside-marriage\">Relationships outside marriage</h3>\n\n<p>All sex outside marriage is illegal, irrespective of any relationship you may have with your partner in the UK. If the UAE authorities become aware that you\u2019re conducting a sexual relationship outside marriage (as recognised by them), you run the risk of prosecution, imprisonment and/or a fine and deportation. It\u2019s against the law to live together, or to share the same hotel room, with someone of the opposite sex to whom you aren\u2019t married or closely related.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the laws on sex outside marriage, if you become pregnant outside marriage, both you and your partner could face imprisonment and/or deportation. Doctors may ask for proof of marriage during ante-natal checks. An unmarried woman who gives birth in the UAE may also encounter problems when registering the birth of the child in the UAE, and could be arrested, imprisoned or deported. To get a birth certificate from the UAE authorities, you must provide a marriage certificate and the authorities may compare the date of the marriage against the estimated date of conception.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"same-sex-relationships\">Same-sex relationships</h3>\n\n<p>All homosexual sex is illegal and same-sex marriages are not recognised.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE is in many respects a tolerant society and private life is respected, although there have been some reports of individuals being punished for homosexual activity and/or sexual activity outside marriage, particularly where there is any public element, or the behaviour has caused offence. This applies both to expatriate residents and to tourists. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photographymedia\">Photography/media</h3>\n\n<p>Photography of certain government buildings and military installations isn\u2019t allowed. Don\u2019t photograph people without their permission. Men have been arrested for photographing women on beaches. Hobbies like bird watching and plane spotting, may be misunderstood - particularly near military sites, government buildings and airports. In February 2015, 3 British nationals were arrested while plane spotting at UAE airports. They were detained for 2 months.</p>\n\n<p>Posting material (including videos and photographs) online that is critical of the UAE government, companies or individuals, or related to incidents in the UAE, or appearing to abuse/ridicule/criticise the country or its authorities, or that is culturally insensitive, may be considered a crime punishable under UAE law. There have been cases of individuals being detained, prosecuted and/or convicted for posting this type of material.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE authorities announced on 7 June 2017 that showing sympathy for Qatar on social media or by any other means of communication is an offence. Offenders could be imprisoned and subject to a substantial fine.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to carry out media activity related to the production, transmission and/or distribution of printed, digital, audio, video and/or visual information, you will be required to obtain the appropriate permission from the Emirati authorities in advance. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment and a substantial fine.</p>\n\n<p>Further information about media activity and how to obtain the necessary permits can be accessed by registering on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nmc.gov.ae/en-us/Pages/MediaLicenses.aspx\">National Media Council website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fundraisingcharitable-acts\">Fundraising/charitable acts</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering undertaking or promoting fundraising or other acts of charity in (or while passing through) the UAE, bear in mind that these activities, including where conducted online and via social media, are heavily regulated. You should be fully aware of the legal requirements and seek professional advice as necessary. Non-compliance can incur criminal penalties, including heavy fines and/or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buyingproperty\">Buying\u00a0property</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to buy property in the UAE, you should seek appropriate professional advice, as you would in the UK.\u00a0A list of lawyers for Abu Dhabi and Dubai is available on the <a href=\"/guidance/how-to-buy-property-in-the-uae\">British Embassy website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-crime\">Financial crime</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes, including fraud, bouncing cheques (including post-dated and \u2018security cheques\u2019) and the non-payment of bills (including hotel bills) can often result in imprisonment and/or a fine. Bank accounts and other assets can also be frozen.<br>\nBail is generally not available to non-residents of the UAE who are arrested for financial crimes. Those convicted will not generally be released from jail until the debt is paid or waived and they may even remain in jail after a debt has been paid if there is an outstanding sentence to be served.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"weapons-and-related-equipment\">Weapons and related equipment</h3>\n\n<p>Weapons, ammunition, body protection and related equipment (like cleaning kits, gun belts, etc), however small the quantity and whatever the purpose, all require permission before entering or transiting the UAE.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"technical-equipment\">Technical equipment</h3>\n\n<p>Equipment like satellite phones, listening or recording devices, radio transmitters, powerful cameras or binoculars, may require a licence for use in the UAE.
