This was introduced on 28 September until further notice and involves a curfew from 9pm to 6am. A full list of regions covered by the Martial Law, and a list of sectors which could be exempt from the curfew and how to gain exemption permission has been published on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/3307000.html\">Trend News Site</a>. The Cabinet of Ministers have confirmed that travel to the airport for travel is possible if necessary during curfew hours.

Take sensible precautions: be vigilant, avoid carrying large sums of money and don\u2019t walk alone at night. Try to arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible by a private/company driver, or a known taxi firm.</p>\n\n<p>You can report a crime at any local police station or by telephoning the police on 102. English speaking staff are available on the telephone, but when reporting a crime at a police station take someone with you who can interpret. Don\u2019t sign any documents you don\u2019t understand.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware of ad hoc reports of foreign national residents being asked to make undocumented payments while making car journeys or seeking medical treatment.

Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  The Nagorno-Karabakh area is the subject of a continuing dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and although a cease-fire has been in place since 1994 there are regular exchanges of gunfire across the Line of Contact and the international borders between Azerbaijan and Armenia where tensions remain high. Some areas may be heavily land mined.</p>\n\n<p>According to Azerbaijani legislation, entering Nagorno Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities constitutes a criminal offence. There have been some recent reports that the government of Azerbaijan has started criminal proceedings against foreign citizens, including British nationals, for visiting and working in Nagorno Karabakh without official permission. It\u2019s possible that these proceedings could include requests for individuals who are outside Azerbaijan to be extradited to Azerbaijan to stand trial.</p>\n\n<p>The borders between Iran and Azerbaijan, and Georgia and Azerbaijan are temporarily closed.</p>\n\n<p>The land border between Azerbaijan and Russia (Dagestan) is also closed. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> continues to advises against all travel to Dagestan (for further details, see our travel advice page for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/russia\">Russia</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>The Azerbaijani authorities have introduced restrictions on road travel for private vehicles and public transport.  Vehicles will not be allowed to travel between the Azerbaijani regions and the area comprising Baku city, Sumgayit city and the Absheron Peninsular. Residents will be permitted to return to their places of registration.</p>\n\n<p>You need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Azerbaijan. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Azerbaijan. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re temporarily or permanently resident in Azerbaijan, after one month of your residence permit being issued you will only be able to drive with an Azerbaijan-issued driving licence. Driving licences are issued through <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://asan.gov.az/en\">ASAN Service Offices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel</p>\n\n<p>Right hand drive cars are not permitted in Azerbaijan.</p>\n\n<p>Many cars are poorly maintained, and the standard of driving is erratic. Accidents are common, mainly due to poor or reckless driving and inconsistent enforcement of traffic rules. One-way only signs are often ignored and road closures and diversions are not marked. Traffic lights are often switched to flashing amber at night, which means both directions can proceed with caution.</p>\n\n<p>There are a variety of taxi options available in Baku including private hire, app-based, and London-style metered cabs. Some visitors have reported being severely over-charged by local taxis. When using taxis you should agree a fare up front, or make sure the taxi meter is switched on. You should also check that the taxi has working seatbelts.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving particularly at night. Many roads are of poor quality and badly lit.</p>\n\n<p>Drink driving laws are strict and there is a zero limit on drinking alcohol and driving. Observe the speed limit and make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in a vehicle that\u2019s travelling at an unsafe speed you should instruct the driver to slow down.</p>\n\n<p>In the winter months snowfall often causes problems. Keep a blanket, shovel, torch, snacks and old carpet (to help if you get stuck in snow) if you intend to travel out of Baku in the winter months, or if heavy snowfall is forecast in Baku.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/countries/azerbaijan/\">RAC</a> guide on driving in Azerbaijan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>The Baku Metro is reasonably maintained and has basic safety equipment and procedures. Signs are in Azerbaijani and English. There are police at each station and security checks of bags and belongings.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel by overland train, secure your valuables, don\u2019t leave the compartment unattended, and lock the door from the inside.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Azerbaijan can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=4K\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">International Civil Aviation Organisation audit</a>\u00a0of aviation safety oversight found that the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Azerbaijan was generally above the global average.</p>\n\n<p>The European Commission publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm\">list of airlines banned from operating within the EU</a>.

The fact that an airline is not included in the list does not automatically mean that it meets the applicable safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is unable to offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>The political situation in Azerbaijan is generally calm, but demonstrations and opposition rallies can occur.</p>\n\n<p>Following recent military clashes on the international border with Armenia in Azerbaijan\u2019s Tovuz region, large gatherings / demonstrations have spontaneously taken place in Baku and other cities.  Further gatherings cannot be ruled out. You should avoid large gatherings and any demonstrations.  These could escalate without warning.  Pay close attention to your personal security and monitor the media for information about possible safety or security risks and be alert to local and regional developments, which may trigger public disturbances.
