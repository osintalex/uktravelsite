Groups often use road blockades as a form of protest, without warning. Public transport can be disrupted at very short notice and strikes may result in widespread road blockades, including on roads to and from airports. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://transitabilidad.abc.gob.bo/mapa/\">Bolivian road authority website</a> gives up-to-date information on which roads are blocked.

If you do use a taxi choose a \u2018radio taxi\u2019, which is identifiable by the telephone number and the name of the taxi company on the vehicle\u2019s roof. If possible, request a taxi by phone, make a note of the taxi\u2019s registration number and telephone number before you set off. This type of taxi should carry no other passengers.</p>\n\n<p>A list of taxi companies registered with the Mayor\u2019s office in La Paz is available in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.la-razon.com/ciudades/Servicio-empresas-radiotaxi-aval-edil-operar-La_Paz_0_2145385442.html#hd\">this news article</a>. According to the Mayor\u2019s office, registered taxis display a sticker on their windscreen or windows.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals sometimes impersonate police officers and act in collusion with bogus taxis to target foreigners. False police ID cards, uniforms and even false police stations have been used to fool victims. The criminal pretends to be a friendly tourist. A bogus police officer then approaches and asks for passports and other information. The victim is then persuaded to get into a taxi where he/she is robbed or taken to cash points to withdraw money.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant and call local authorities if you suspect that impostors are targeting you. You can\u2019t be searched without a written order from a state prosecutor. The Tourist Police toll-free number is 800-14-0081.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of individuals offering help at taxi points and at bus terminals where thieves work in teams to distract their victims.</p>\n\n<p>There is a general risk of \u2018express kidnappings\u2019 - short-term, opportunistic abductions, aimed at extracting cash. Victims are normally selected at random and held for up to several days while criminals use stolen bank or credit cards. Foreign visitors are particularly vulnerable when entering Bolivia at overland border points with Peru, Chile and Argentina.  If you are travelling from Copacabana to La Paz, try to use direct buses. Take particular care on arrival, especially in the Cementerio General, area in La Paz where a number of incidents have been reported. There have also been reports of similar incidents in the Sopocachi area of La Paz.</p>\n\n<p>Take care around transport in tourist sites such as Rurrenabaque. Attacks on lone travellers taking motorbike taxis have been reported.</p>\n\n<p>Female travellers should be vigilant inside clubs and hostels. Rape and sexual assault incidents have been reported. Be cautious if you\u2019re approached by strangers and if possible, lock your room when you return to your hotel/hostel.</p>\n\n<p>Petty crime is common in central La Paz and other popular tourist destinations like Sagarnaga Street, on buses and in other crowded areas.</p>\n\n<p>Always keep your passport, air ticket and other valuable items in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adventure-tourism\">Adventure tourism</h3>\n\n<p>Bolivia offers a number of adventure activities, including mountain biking, salt flat tours and jungle expeditions.

Most roads are unpaved rough tracks. 4-wheel drive vehicles are often the best means of transport, especially during the rainy season. Broken-down vehicles with no warning lights are a frequent hazard on roads at night.</p>\n\n<p>Many taxis and most of the bus companies don\u2019t meet European standards and rarely have seat belts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=CP\">Aviation Safety network.</a></p>\n\n<p>The rainy season may affect air travel; flights may be delayed or cancelled at short notice.
