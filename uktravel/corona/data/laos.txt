The Tourist Police can be contacted in Vientiane on 021-251-128.</p>\n\n<p>Petty crime can occur, especially in tourist areas and outside banks after customers have withdrawn money. When you are withdrawing money from ATMs or across the counter be aware of who may be watching. Try to have someone with you and avoid carrying passport, debit and credit cards, and cash in the same bag, to prevent a total loss. There has been an increase in reports of random bag snatches in 2020, many being carried out by people on motorcycles. Take sensible precautions, hold your bags on the side away from the road, and do not have valuables on display.</p>\n\n<p>Safes provided in hotels and guesthouses aren\u2019t necessarily secure. Consider using your own lock where possible. Take care of your possessions if you\u2019re travelling long distances, or overnight, by public transport. Be particularly vigilant travelling at night by bicycle or motorcycle, especially if you\u2019re alone. Stick to well-used, well lit roads and carry a personal alarm if possible. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid unlit roads, especially if you\u2019re alone.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t leave your passport as a deposit or guarantee when hiring motorcycles. There have been reports of rental companies arranging for rented motorcycles to be deliberately stolen or damaged resulting in the retention of the passport and payment of a heavy fine. Always make sure your travel insurance covers medical and other costs associated with motorcycle rental and accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Local law enforcement responses to crimes, even violent crimes, are often limited. Foreigners attempting to report crimes have reported finding police stations closed, emergency telephone numbers unanswered, or police lacking transportation or authorisation to investigate crimes that occur at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>Specific events or political disputes may trigger violent protests. You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. Keep yourself informed of local developments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>Unexploded mines and ordinances are a hazard throughout Laos, and kill about 50 people each year. The risk is particularly high in Xieng Khouang Province (Plain of Jars), Luang Prabang Province and areas of the Lao-Vietnamese border, formerly the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Mined areas are often unmarked.\u00a0Don\u2019t stray off main routes in rural areas, and don\u2019t pick up metal objects.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed clashes along with attacks on infrastructure by anti-government groups reported as recently as July 2020 in Xaisomboun Province. Further skirmishes may occur.</p>\n\n<p>Take care near the border with Myanmar. This is a well-known drugs trade-route where armed groups operate.</p>\n\n<p>There have been small-scale clashes between anti-government groups and government troops in isolated areas along the Lao-Thai border. The local law enforcement agencies have limited capability to counter these threats.</p>\n\n<p>You should get permission from the village chief, district head, provincial governor or national tourism authority for any travel perceived as out of the ordinary, including business, extensive photography, or scientific research of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>You may be stopped by the police at any time, particularly in the evening, and asked to show identification papers before being allowed to travel on. You should comply with requests to stop at checkpoints and roadblocks.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, there were a number of roadside attacks along Route 13 between Kasi and Phou Kon in Vientiane Province. Although none have been reported recently, you \nshould be vigilant and take extra care if you travel on this road.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n\n<p>There have been some incidents where tourists have had drinks or food spiked with drugs. Never leave food or drink unattended. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers at bars, clubs, restaurants and parties.</p>\n\n<p>All recreational drugs are illegal in Laos and penalties are harsh with a number of Lao nationals having been sentenced to the death penalty in 2019.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=RDPL\">Aviation Safety network.</a></p>\n\n<p>In 2015 the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Laos.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>A departure tax is now included in the price of the air ticket and is no longer paid separately in cash.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Roads in Laos are in poor condition and vehicles are not generally maintained to UK standards. Other road users might not show the same level of consideration as in the UK. Travel after dark significantly increases the risk of an accident as vehicles often do not have lights. Livestock also stray on to the roads causing accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Motorbike rentals might not automatically provide a helmet, budget to purchase one locally. Take extra care when using public transport or shared vehicles, which might be overcrowded and unsafe. You can report road accidents to a dedicated police number +856 20 5666 9090.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a road accident you will have to pay compensation for third party property damage and injury, even if you are not at fault. As a general rule, the Lao authorities will overwhelmingly find in favour of Lao citizens, regardless of the situation. Lao insurers only meet a small proportion of the costs of an accident and will not cover this compensation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-based-activities\">Water-based activities</h3>\n<p>Travel on the Mekong River by speedboat and slow-boat can be dangerous, especially when water levels are low. Make sure you travel with a company that provides lifejackets.</p>\n\n<p>White water rafting, kayaking, tubing and other water-based activities, including swimming in the Mekong, are dangerous and incidents of drowning and serious injuries have been reported. Laos does not have the same health and safety expectations as in the UK. There might not be warning signs or safety advice provided, even where it\u2019s needed.

For example refrain from photographing monks around temples and during alms giving ceremonies. Women should also cover their shoulders, including when swimming in waterfalls.</p>\n\n<p>Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities are harsh, with limited access to healthcare. If a British national is arrested and detained in Laos, the Laos authorities must inform the British Embassy on the prisoner\u2019s formal request.

Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
