Armed robbery, mugging, carjacking, and burglary are all common and are often accompanied by extreme levels of violence \u2013 do not resist an attacker. These crimes can occur on the street or the beach, in supermarket queues or when travelling in private vehicles or public transport, or indoors.  Remain alert and avoid using your mobile phone or displaying other electronic equipment or valuables on the street or in a vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Private security services, including the use of armoured cars, are increasingly becoming the standard for business and official visitors and residents. Use of armoured vehicles is now common in Caracas, especially after dark and for transport to/from the airport.</p>\n\n<p>In Caracas, reasonably priced hotels can be found in safer areas such as Chacao district.  Do not visit \u2018barrios\u2019 (heavily populated slums), not even on organised tours, as these are unsafe.  British nationals walking in the Avila National Park have been robbed at knife/gunpoint. If you want to visit the Avila then stick to popular trails and times (usually the morning) and where possible, go in a group and with someone who knows the park.</p>\n\n<p>Only use pre-booked taxis rather than hailing them in the street. Hotels will normally book a taxi from a reputable company or supply their own vehicle service.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid public transport. A number of robberies at gunpoint have been reported on the Caracas metro. There are regular reports of passengers being robbed on public buses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel\">Travel</h3>\n<p>A number of Venezuela\u2019s land and sea borders are closed. The sea borders with Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao are currently closed, with no air or sea traffic operating between Venezuela and these islands. There are no direct air services between Venezuela and the USA. The land borders with Brazil and Colombia can take time to cross and can be dangerous. If you\u2019re planning travel in the region on any of these routes, contact your travel company for more information.</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care to check the local situation ahead of any travel to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana area of Bol\u00edvar State. Occasionally, protests by locals have led to the closure (sometimes for days) of Canaima airport and main roads (eg parts of Road 10 between El Callao and the Brazilian border). There are  shortages of fuel and other essentials across almost all of the country.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of bribes being solicited by authorities at Maiquetia (Caracas) International Airport.  Normal check-in for flights is 2-3 hours in advance.  Police and immigration checks can be lengthy.  Departure taxes are normally included in the price of a ticket, except at Puerto Ordaz Airport.  Check with your airline before paying anything extra.</p>\n\n<p>Do not make any non-official payments at airports and ask for a receipt for any customs duty payments you make.  If you bring any personal items or merchandise into the country with a total value of over US$1,000 which are considered to be \u201cnew\u201d, you will need to pay import duty.  Further details on import duty taxes can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://declaraciones.seniat.gob.ve/portal/page/portal/MANEJADOR_CONTENIDO_SENIAT/04ADUANAS/4.5PREGUNTAS_FRECUENT/4.5.html\">Venezuelan customs authority (SENIAT)</a> website (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<p>Tourist travel can often involve flying in light aircraft. There have been several accidents in recent years on the main tourist routes, including Los Roques, Canaima and Merida - some with fatalities. A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/index.php\">Aviation Safety network</a>.  The International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out its <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">most recent audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Venezuela in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air and Avior airlines ROI (Avior Venezuela) which is banned from entering the European Union.  UK government officials have been told to avoid using both airlines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-to-and-from-maiquetia-airport-caracas\">Travelling to and from Maiquetia Airport (Caracas)</h3>\n<p>Criminal groups operate in the Maiquetia airport area. Members of these groups work inside the airport to spot passengers who appear to be wealthy and then inform car hijackers and muggers waiting on the roads outside the airport. Some passengers have been followed from the airport and assaulted on the way to or on arrival at their destination in Caracas. Avoid displaying expensive jewellery, electronic items or other valuables; don\u2019t bring large amounts of cash to Venezuela; and be alert at all times. Passengers have also been robbed when returning to their cars at the airport car park.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on the road between Caracas and Maiquetia airport during the hours of darkness. There are fewer cars on the road during this time and the risk of crime is much higher. Don\u2019t stay at an airport hotel unless you can make safe transport arrangements between the hotel and the airport.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed robberies on buses travelling to Maiquetia Airport, and along Avenida Libertador in Caracas. Ideally, arrange to be met at the airport by friends, business contacts, or your tour operator. If that isn\u2019t possible, consider travelling by licensed taxi. If you have to take a taxi, use a licensed taxi from the official taxi rank outside the arrivals hall.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of bogus taxi-drivers at the airport. Don\u2019t accept offers of transport in the arrivals hall and do not board a taxi if there are other passengers already inside the car.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re coming to Venezuela to work, bring a letter from your employer and your local contact organisation details (including a Spanish translation). There have been occasions when passengers have been asked for bribes at the airport. Exchange currency at official exchange booths only.</p>\n\n<p>The National Guard carries out random drug and security checks at Maiquetia Airport, particularly on departure. Departing passengers are sometimes asked to accompany an officer to a local hospital for an x-ray. Beware of bogus security officials; if you\u2019re in any doubt ask other airline or airport staff.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Heavy rains and lack of maintenance can affect road conditions. Seek local advice about your route before you set out, leave plenty of time for your journey and stick to the main roads. Avoid travelling after dark.</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care to check the local situation ahead of any travel and particularly to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana areas of Bol\u00edvar State.  Fuel shortages are common across all parts of the country.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Venezuela using a British driving licence for up to 1 year. After that you will need to get a Venezuelan driving licence. Make sure you have copies of insurance documents, driving licence and passport with you at all times. Failure to produce documents can result in your vehicle being seized by the police.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular police and National Guard checkpoints throughout the country. Drive slowly through these and stop if asked to do so. There have been reports of attempts by the police and National Guard to extract bribes. Ask for a written record giving details of the offence and the officer\u2019s details.   Most major roads charge tolls.</p>\n\n<p>All vehicles must carry a spare tyre, wheel block, jack and reflector triangle. Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal but common, especially during weekends. Many vehicles are in poor condition and drivers routinely ignore red lights. In the event of an accident, both vehicles must remain in the position of the accident until a traffic police officer arrives. Insurance companies will not pay claims on vehicles that have been moved without a police accident report.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid hitchhiking and cycling at all costs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against boats in and around Venezuela\u2019s waters, especially east of Puerto La Cruz and in waters between Venezuela and Trinidad. Take suitable precautions and avoid these areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"beaches\">Beaches</h3>\n<p>The waters of the Caribbean can be deceptive. There are strong currents and undertows in some areas that can make swimming hazardous. Lifeguards and warnings are not normally in place.</p>\n\n<p>Security incidents are common on beaches at any time of day.  Beach clubs can offer better security as can going with people that know the area.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorist attacks in Venezuela can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Zulia State (bordering Colombia) is subject to prolonged power cuts, water shortages, violence and local conflict. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/venezuela/safety-and-security\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>In the event of prolonged power cuts and/or a deterioration on the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be limited in the assistance that it can provide. You should remain vigilant, avoid all demonstrations (tear gas and buck shot can be used), monitor developments closely and keep up to date with this travel advice.  You should consider storing several days\u2019 worth of dried/tinned food and water.</p>\n\n<p>Power cuts also affect mobile signals and internet. Caracas International Airport is often affected during power failures, causing flights to be delayed or cancelled. This could affect your ability to depart Venezuela. You should remain in close contact with your airline or travel agent to see if your flight is affected.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Venezuela can\u2019t be ruled out.
