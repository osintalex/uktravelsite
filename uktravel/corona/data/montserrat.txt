In addition there are three areas around the coastline which are designated Maritime Exclusion Zones where no shipping should enter. Seek local advice about safety precautions and access restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>A volcanic <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mvo.ms\">Hazard Level System</a> was introduced in 2014 for the Exclusion Zone. It rates the Level of Volcanic activity on a scale from 0-5; where 5 is the highest.

The current Hazard Level is 1 and allows unlimited access to Zones A, B, C and F. Permission is required for access to Zone V. At this level the maritime zones E and W can only be transited during daylight hours and no anchorage is allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Around 40% of the island is unaffected by volcanic activity but these areas may be prone to ash falls and volcanic gases during any volcanic activity and if the wind is blowing from south to north.
