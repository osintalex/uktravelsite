Watch out for pick-pockets particularly in airports and on public transport. As a foreigner, you may be a target for criminals who may assume you are carrying large amounts of cash. Four wheel drive and luxury vehicles are also popular targets. Report all incidents of crime to the local police and get a report.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Isolated incidents of armed violence and vehicle explosions in major cities are usually linked to organised crime and not directed against foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>Check local developments before and during your journey.

Roads are particularly bad in rural areas and after bad weather. There is a risk of landslides and flooding.

European Green Card vehicle insurance isn\u2019t valid. You should buy local third party insurance at the border or from the nearest town at the earliest opportunity. Make sure you have enough cash in Euros to pay for insurance and fuel. The quality of fuel varies. There are sometimes delays at the border crossings between Kosovo and North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania, and Kosovo and Serbia. These are common around festive periods and during the summer months.</p>\n\n<p>Many Serbian car hire firms will not allow their vehicles to be driven in Kosovo, and vice-versa, due to concerns about the security situation. There have been some incidents where Serbian registered cars have been targeted in more isolated areas of Kosovo.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis are readily available in Pristina, but the condition of the vehicle and standard of driving vary.
