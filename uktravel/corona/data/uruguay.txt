Muggings and robberies (sometimes armed) also take place. Keep valuables, spare cash and spare credit cards in a safe. Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs and where possible use machines that are not on the street (eg, shopping centres or banks). Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing expensive jewellery. Consider carrying cash and bankcards in separate pockets and only take with you the money you need at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Cars left on the streets at night in Montevideo are regularly broken into. Try to park in a paid car park or a well-lit and busy area. Always remember to lock your car and avoid leaving valuables, luggage, personal documents and cash in the vehicle. Don\u2019t drive with bags or other valuables visible inside your vehicle, especially not on the front seat.  There have been instances of windows being smashed and valuables grabbed when waiting at traffic lights and junctions.</p>\n\n<p>Try to keep away from isolated or poorly lit areas at night and avoid walking downtown or in the port area alone.</p>\n\n<p>While crime rates are generally lower in other parts of Uruguay, you should remain alert and take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to report a crime, you must go to the nearest police station.

Motorbikes often go the wrong way down one way streets so always look both ways when crossing junctions. Stop signs, traffic lights and speed limits are sometimes ignored. You must use dipped headlights during the day.
