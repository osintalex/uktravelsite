There are some regional variations, but  they generally include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a ban on large social gatherings, where physical distancing is not possible</li>\n  <li>closure of some public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres in affected cities and regions</li>\n  <li>curfew or closure of bars and restaurants in affected cities and regions</li>\n  <li>some public transport offering only a limited service</li>\n  <li>mandatory wearing of face masks in indoor settings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-spaces-and-services\">Public spaces and services</h2>\n<p>Anyone showing symptoms associated with coronavirus will be barred from domestic flights and some inter-city train services. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate.</p>\n\n<p>The Canadian authorities recommend the use of non-medical masks/facial coverings when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, including on public transportation. Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one.</p>\n\n<p>Federal,  provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public or enclosed spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus.
