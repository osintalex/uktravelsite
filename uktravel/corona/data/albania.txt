Crime and violence does occur in some areas, but reports of crime specifically targeting foreigners are rare. There have been occasional shootings and small explosions, but these appear to be related to internal disputes over criminal, business or political interests.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h3>\n\n<p>In December 2009 Albania officially declared it had met its\u00a0 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/CA826818C8330D2BC1257180004B1B2E?OpenDocument\">\u2018Ottawa Convention Article 5\u2019</a> obligations and had reached mine-free status.\u00a0However, when visiting hill towns on the northern border with Kosovo you should take care, particularly if hiking and follow the signs warning about unexploded landmines and other unexploded ordnance.

You can also drive in Albania with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay longer than one year, or live in Albania, you will need to apply for an Albanian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving can be very hazardous. Roads are poor, especially in rural areas. Street lighting in urban areas is subject to power cuts. Elsewhere, even on the major inter-urban arterial routes, there is no street lighting. If you are travelling at night, watch out for unmarked road works, potholes and unlit vehicles. Four-wheel drive vehicles are often more practical on rural and minor roads.</p>\n\n<p>Albanian driving can often be aggressive and erratic. Deaths from road traffic accidents are amongst the highest in Europe.  Police have taken some measures to decrease the number of accidents. Minor traffic disputes can quickly escalate, especially as some motorists could be armed. Avoid reacting to provocative behaviour by other road users. If you are involved in a traffic accident, even a minor one, you are supposed to wait until the police arrive. This will usually happen quickly in built-up areas.</p>\n\n<p>If you are intending to import a vehicle into Albania, make sure you have all the necessary papers on arrival at the border. Consult the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ambasadat.gov.al/united-kingdom/en\">Albanian Embassy</a>\u00a0in London before you leave.
