Women should avoid going out alone at night, and may suffer harassment even during the day.</p>\n\n<p>There have been instances of sexual assault, including rape, reported to the British Embassy. This has included suspected use of \u2019date-rape\u2019 drugs targeting foreigners. Don\u2019t accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.</p>\n\n<p>You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK.

The Tajik Government has said that Daesh/ISIS is responsible. Dushanbe remains calm, and there is no special police presence on the streets or at checkpoints. You should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Tajik/Uzbek border.</p>\n\n<p>The Tajik-Kyrgyz border is disputed. Localised violence erupts occasionally and the border can be closed at short notice, particularly near the Vorukh enclave. There were clashes between Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards and civilians in June 2018 and there have been a number of security incidents in recent months.  Previous incidents have involved firearms. There\u2019s a risk of further localised violence and border closures at any time. You should remain vigilant in border areas and check local media reports before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t venture off-road in areas immediately adjoining the Afghan, Uzbek and Kyrgyz borders, as there are both marked and unmarked minefields.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-crossings\">Border crossings</h3>\n\n<p>Tajikistan\u2019s borders with neighbouring countries are subject to closure without notice. Check in advance which border posts are currently open.</p>\n\n<p>The crossing points on the Tajik/Kyrgyz border at Guliston (Isfara region), Avchikalacha (Sughd region) and Kizil Art (Gorno-Badakhshan region) are open to British nationals. The border at Karamik (Jirgatol region) is currently only open to Tajik and Kyrgyz nationals, although this may change in the future following talks between the two countries.</p>\n\n<p>The crossing points on the Tajik/Uzbek border at Bratstvo (Tursunzade region), and at Fotehobod and Patar/Rabot (Sughd region) and the Panjakent-Samarkand border are open to British nationals holding visas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gorno-badakhshan-autonomous-oblast\">Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast</h3>\n\n<p>The government of Tajikistan sometimes suspends issuing permits for travel to the Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) by foreign nationals who enter Tajikistan on a tourist visa. This can happen at short notice, depending on the security situation in the area. If you\u2019re considering travel to the GBAO you should contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.tajembassy.org.uk/\">Embassy of Tajikistan</a> for up to date information on whether permits are being issued.</p>\n\n<p>On 13 January a clash in the regional capital Khorog between local youths and the security forces resulted in the use of non-lethal weapons and 1 person was hospitalised. There is a possibility of further unrest.</p>\n\n<p>Tensions in Khorog have risen since September 2018. In November and December 2018 there were small scale clashes between local youths and the security forces.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling in the region, you should remain vigilant in public places and be alert to any security announcements by the Tajik authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Several areas of the GBAO and other parts of the country are damaged by flooding in the spring and winter seasons and roads are often closed. Most of the infrastructure has been repaired, but many roads, including the Pamir Highway, are currently open but not fully repaired.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tavildara-region\">Tavildara region</h3>\n\n<p>Take local advice in the Tavildara region of central Tajikistan as there are a few minefields dating from the civil war in the mountains.

You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Roads outside the main towns are poorly-maintained and often only accessible by 4-wheel drive vehicles. Conditions are particularly treacherous in spring due to the risk of avalanches and landslides. Many interior roads are only open in the summer months. It is possible to drive from Dushanbe to the north and Tajikistan\u2019s second city, Khujand, via a tunnel, but this road is particularly dangerous in winter due to icy conditions and drivers can be trapped for a long time if caught in an avalanche because of the remoteness. The roads to GBAO are often closed in the winter.  Check local road conditions prior to travel..</p>\n\n<p>Local vehicles are poorly-maintained and driving standards are basic. Petrol stations are rare outside towns and there are no breakdown companies. Make sure you take all you need for your journey, allowing for delays. Emergency communications such as satellite phones are advisable for travel outside towns. Neighbouring countries may close borders temporarily.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Flights in Tajikistan may be cancelled at short notice or substantially delayed. Overloading on local flights is not uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>Instances of harassment by officials at Dushanbe International Airport have been reported to the British Embassy. This typically involves requests for payment for allegedly incorrect documentation or other offences. Some reports state that airport officials have acted in an intimidating manner. You should ensure, through your hotel or directly with the Tajikistan Office of Visas and Registration (OVIR) that your documentation and papers are in order before passing through border control at the airport. If you suffer harassment or intimidation at the airport you should report this to your travel agent and/or the consular bureau at the airport.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.

The Tajik Government has said that Daesh/ISIS is responsible. Dushanbe remains calm, and there is no special police presence on the streets or at checkpoints. You should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Tajik/Uzbek border. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/safety-and-security#local-travel\">Local travel</a> and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On 29 July 2018, 4 tourists were killed in a deliberate attack while cycling in the south of the country.  You should exercise extreme caution and vigilance, particularly if hiking or cycling in the countryside. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular clashes between the Taliban and Afghan government forces in north-east Afghanistan close to the border with Tajikistan. This border is also used by drug smugglers who often engage in armed clashes with Tajik security forces.</p>\n\n<p>Check local advice before travelling to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast in the East, as the area may be closed to visitors at short notice. Tensions in the regional capital, Khorog, have risen since September 2018. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/safety-and-security#gorno-badakhshan-autonomous-oblast\">Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are occasional skirmishes along the disputed Tajik/Kyrgyz border. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/safety-and-security#border-areas\">Border areas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Tourism, health and transport infrastructure is poor and travel requires careful planning. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/safety-and-security\">Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.</p>\n\n", "updated_at": "2020-10-06T09:01:38Z", "reviewed_at": "2020-10-06T09:01:38Z", "alert_status": [], "max_cache_time": 10, "email_signup_link": "/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/email-signup", "change_description": "Updated information on international travel ('Coronavirus' ).", "change_history": [{"note": "Latest update: Summary and Terrorism section - updated information and advice on the threat from terrorism in Tajikistan, reflecting an increased threat", "public_timestamp": "2018-11-26T16:16:32.909Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Health Section \u2013 revised guidance on sources of health information before travel", "public_timestamp": "2018-12-27T16:42:37.316Z"}, {"note": "Latest update: Safety and security section (Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO)) -  on 13 January a clash in Khorog between local youths and security forces resulted in the use of non-lethal weapons and 1 person was hospitalised;
