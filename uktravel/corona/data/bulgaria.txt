However, you should take care of yourself and your belongings in the same way as you would do in the UK. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime, particularly in larger cities. Watch out for pickpockets and bag thefts in tourist areas and major public transport hubs, including airports. Be vigilant at all times, particularly late at night. If you wish to report a crime, call the local police on 112 and make sure you get a crime report.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists are targeted by thieves and pickpockets in Sunny Beach and other larger cities and resorts. Don\u2019t take valuables to the beach and be wary of poorly lit roads around the resort at night. There has been an increase in thefts on the bus from Nessebar to Sunny Beach.  Burglaries have been reported from hotel rooms in Sunny Beach. Make sure you lock your room (including windows and balcony doors) and keep your valuables locked in a safe. Don\u2019t change money on the streets in Sunny Beach, only at licensed exchange points, banks or hotels.</p>\n\n<p>Some tourists have been victims of overcharging in strip clubs in Sofia and in some resorts like Bansko, Borovets and Sunny Beach. Overcharging can amount to hundreds of pounds and victims have been threatened with violence if they don\u2019t pay.</p>\n\n<p>Stun guns, torch stun guns and other weapons like knives, pepper spray and CS gas can be bought in shops in and around Burgas and Sunny Beach. Many of these weapons <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/import-controls-on-offensive-weapons\">are illegal in the UK</a> and importing them could result in a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of car tyres being deliberately punctured across Bulgaria. While investigating the puncture, someone distracts the driver and personal belongings and documents are stolen from the vehicle. Be vigilant if you have to stop in these circumstances and make sure your belongings are secure.</p>\n\n<p>Break-ins have occurred in properties in the residential areas of cities and rural areas.  Seek local advice on security for your home.</p>\n\n<p>For all types of emergency (fire, ambulance, police) you can dial 112.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>Taxis are plentiful and cheap by UK standards, although vehicles may not be in very good condition. Most taxis are metered and yellow taxis are generally considered reliable. Avoid taxis parked outside hotels or in tourist areas. Ask your hotel to call a taxi or flag down a passing taxi with a green \u2018available\u2019 light in the window. Check the licence sticker and the tariffs on the window before getting in as they can vary considerably.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of robberies and threatening behaviour by taxi drivers in Sunny Beach. Use a taxi recommended by your tour operator or accommodation provider.</p>\n\n<p>There has also been an increase in the number of unlicensed taxis from Sofia airport overcharging passengers. If you\u2019re travelling from the airport, make sure you take an official, licensed taxi. There is an official taxi rank in the arrivals hall.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 628 road deaths in Bulgaria (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>).

If you have hired a car you must have the original contract document, which should state that the vehicle can be brought into Bulgaria. Border officials will impound your vehicle if they are not satisfied that you own it or have permission to use it in Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<p>Under Bulgarian law, vehicles that are registered outside the EU are considered to be \u2018temporarily imported\u2019 when driven inside Bulgaria. If they are stolen on Bulgarian soil, the owners will be liable for import duty and related taxes. Cars registered in the Channel Islands and the Isles of Man are subject to this legislation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n<p>Take care when driving, particularly at night. Many roads are in poor condition and road works are often unlit or unmarked. Driving standards are generally poor. Avoid confrontations with aggressive drivers. Stick to the speed limit and make sure your vehicle is roadworthy. On the spot fines are charged for minor violations.

You can buy one at the border, or from post offices, large petrol stations and DZI bank offices and online from BG Toll. Rates are much higher for freight vehicles and coaches carrying 8 or more passengers. You\u2019ll be fined if you don\u2019t have a vignette.</p>\n\n<p>You must drive with running lights or dipped beam headlights throughout the year, even during the daytime. It\u2019s compulsory to carry the following equipment in your vehicle: fire extinguisher (not required for 2-wheeled vehicles), a first-aid kit and a warning triangle (not required for 2-wheeled vehicles). A reflective jacket must be used by anyone who steps on to the road in a breakdown or emergency. Snow chains must be carried from 1 November until 1 March and used when the relevant sign is displayed.

You should avoid all protests, keep up to date with media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. Such protests can become violent without warning and are best avoided. There are currently ongoing protests against the Government in Sofia city centre around the National Assembly and President\u2019s buildings that should be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of pickpockets, bag thefts and street attacks on visitors in city centres and coastal resorts especially in crowded areas like buses, trains and busy streets. There has been an increase in thefts on the bus from Nessebar to Sunny Beach. Keep valuables in a safe. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria/safety-and-security\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of robberies and threatening behaviour by taxi drivers in Sunny Beach. There has also been an increase in the number of unlicensed taxis from Sofia airport overcharging passengers. If you\u2019re travelling from the airport, make sure you take an official, licensed taxi. There is an official taxi rank in the arrivals hall.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria/safety-and-security#local-travel\">Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Bulgaria can\u2019t be ruled out. On 30 December 2016, the Bulgarian authorities announced heightened security measures in all cities, winter ski resorts, and places where large gatherings are expected. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay. You can find more information about the action you can take if you have suffered a personal injury on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/legal-system/personal-injury/personal-injuries/\">Citizens Advice website</a>. You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness.
