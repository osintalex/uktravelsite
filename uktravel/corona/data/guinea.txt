These crimes are often carried out by individuals dressed in police or military uniforms and carrying military weapons. There have been incidents of violent car-jackings, especially in the outlying suburbs of Conakry. Burglaries and break-ins are common.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of robberies on the roads to Mamou, Faranah, Kissidougou, Guekedou, Macenta, Nzerekore. The British Embassy Conakry is aware of reports of police extorting cash from foreigners and Guineans.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to arrive in Conakry on a flight after dark you should arrange your airport transfer before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Those involved in trading gold and diamonds should take particular care; this trade attracts criminal gangs, who are known to resort to kidnapping and extortion. Trading scams involving diamonds, gold export and gold certification have been reported.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Political tensions are high. Demonstrations are likely to continue following the presidential elections that were held on 18 October.  Public gatherings and demonstrations can be called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent.  You should avoid the demonstrations and crowds, remain aware of your surroundings, moving quickly to a safe place if you see signs of disturbances or unrest, and monitor the local media for any changes.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years there have been many deaths of protestors and bystanders during protests as well as hundreds injured.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings, particularly when roads are blocked and crowds are gathering. Avoid large demonstrations or rallies (both political and non-political), particularly those close to military barracks and regularly monitor local and international media reports.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cVilles mortes\u201d (general strikes) do happen intermittently and you should be particularly vigilant when these occur.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Areas of Guinea bordering Senegal, Guinea Bissau, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone are often tense with an increased military presence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>All valid UK driving licences should be accepted. If you have a driving licence that is not of the European Communities model, you may wish to voluntarily update your licence before travel as acceptance cannot be guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, older licences may be accompanied by an <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. You can get International Driving Permits over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an International Driving Permit outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Road travel is hazardous during the rainy season from May to October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season. Avoid travel outside cities after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis and long distance buses are poorly maintained, and the drivers often unqualified. Few motorists have any form of insurance. Most major hotels and travel agencies offer cars for hire, with a chauffeur if required.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of road maintenance is low. Beware of deep potholes. Many roads are not metalled and are not repaired after the rainy season. Roads within Conakry and other principal towns can quickly become flooded and impassable.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Supplies of fuel may run low from time to time; it is worth considering carrying an emergency stock, especially when making a long journey.</p>\n\n<p>Police and local militia maintain checkpoints across the country. Vehicles and passengers are submitted to checks on documentation and baggage. Corruption and extortion are common at roadblocks. Occasionally, checkpoints can be a pretext for armed robbery.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The Airport is gradually opening to commercial flights.
