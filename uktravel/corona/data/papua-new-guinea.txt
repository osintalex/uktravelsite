Settlement or squatter areas of towns and cities are particularly dangerous. \u2019Bush knives\u2019 (machetes) and firearms are often used in assaults and thefts. Carjacking, assault (including sexual assaults), bag snatching and robberies are common. Banks and cash machines are attractive targets for criminals. Walking after dark is particularly dangerous in Port Moresby and other urban centres.</p>\n\n<p>Known high-risk crime areas include the area around Parliament House in the Port Moresby suburb of Waigani, particularly outside of working hours, and along the highway between Lae and Nadzab Airport. Criminals use roadblocks outside towns to stop and loot vehicles and then attack the occupants. If you intend to travel in these areas, take great care and consider using a security escort.</p>\n\n<p>Outbreaks of tribal fighting are common across Papua New Guinea, especially in Port Moresby, the Highlands provinces, Hela and Enga provinces. Ethnic disputes can quickly escalate and lead to widespread destruction of property, disruption of normal services and serious injury. Stay alert, monitor local media and consult local contacts, (accommodation or other service providers) before travelling to a new area. Tribal fighters and criminals are becoming increasingly well-armed, including military-grade weaponry. Although foreigners are not normally targeted, you should avoid areas where tribal fighting is taking place.</p>\n\n<p>If you have to travel at night, do so by car, with doors locked and windows up, and travel in convoy or with a security escort.</p>\n\n<p>Most crime is random, but people have been abducted by organised gangs and forced to open office safes while others are held captive until the ransom has been paid.</p>\n\n<p>Rape and sexual assault are problems across the country.\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>don\u2019t\u00a0carry large amounts of cash or openly display expensive jewellery and electronic equipment</li>\n  <li>be vigilant at all times and leave travel plans with friends, relatives or reliable local contacts\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Check your travel insurance before considering any travel to remote areas. The cost of rescue by boat or aircraft can be high.</p>\n\n<p>Damage caused by heavy rain and cyclones can make travel difficult.</p>\n\n<p>There have been serious attacks and robberies along the Kokoda Trail. Although community leaders have assured tourists of their safety and well-being while walking the Kokoda Trail, you should take care. If you intend to walk a trail or track, including the Kokoda trail, avoid walking independently and travel with guides from reputable travel companies. You can get details from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.tpa.papuanewguinea.travel/\">Papua New Guinea Tourism Authority</a> or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kokodatrackauthority.org/\">Kokoda track authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>World War II unexploded ordnance still exists in Papua New Guinea, particularly along the Kokoda Trail, at Milne Bay and Rabaul.</p>\n\n<p>Bougainville Island emerged from a period of separatist conflict with the signature of a Peace Agreement in 2001. As part of that Agreement, a referendum was held in late 2019, which resulted in a 98% vote in favour of independence. Although it has been calm since then, you should take great care when travelling in Bougainville. Be particularly vigilant when travelling beyond Buka into central and southern Bougainville. The mountainous area in central Bougainville around the old Panguna mine is a \u2018No Go Zone\u2019, which you should not enter without prior authorisation from the Mekamui who control the border/check point.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n\n<p>The land boundary between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea stretches for around 760km and is poorly defined.  Border incursions and continuing conflict between the Indonesian government and portions of the indigenous population of West Papua started with the withdrawal of the Dutch colonial administration in 1962.</p>\n\n<p>Occasional clashes along the border with Indonesia between the Indonesian military and the OPM (Organisasi Papua Merdeka \u2013 Free Papua Movement) means the situation remains tense. In response the Papua New Guinean government has strengthened its defence units at its Wutung border post in Sandaun province. You should take extreme care and be prepared for possible sudden closure of the border crossing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Given the challenging terrain, extreme weather conditions and the condition of some remote airfields in PNG, flying in PNG carries greater safety risks than flying in the UK. However, it is the only way to travel between Port Moresby and other provinces. Since 2000 over 20 aircraft accidents have happened in Papua New Guinea. The worst recent crash was on 13 April 2016 when a Sunbird Aviation PNG Britten-Norman Islander aircraft crashed at Kinuga Airport, killing all 12 people on board.</p>\n\n<p>Delays and cancellations of international and domestic flights occur regularly. Check with your airline before travel and be prepared for the possibility of a lengthy wait at the airport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Driving is on the left. When driving, you must keep your driving licence with you at all times. You may use your UK driving licence for up to 1 month. Roads, especially in rural areas, are in a poor state of repair and driving is often erratic. Drivers who are involved in, or witness road accidents may find themselves at personal risk. You should seek police assistance as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t use public buses known locally as PMVs. There have been incidents of armed hold-ups of PMVs and of passengers being attacked and robbed of their personal belongings. There have also been reports of occasional rape attacks on Port Moresby PMVs. Many PMVs are not roadworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis are available in some major centres, but can be badly maintained. If you use a taxi, agree a fare before setting off, irrespective of whether or not there is a meter. Where possible arrange to be met by family, friends or a hotel courtesy bus when arriving at international or domestic airports.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in Papua New Guinea, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.
