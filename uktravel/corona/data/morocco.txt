Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or valuables around with you.</p>\n\n<p>Petty crime is common, especially in tourist areas like the medina quarter of towns/cities and on beaches. Crimes include pick-pocketing, bag snatching and drive-by motorcycle theft of visible jewellery and handbags. Be vigilant when asking for directions and using ATMs as crime and aggressive begging can occur. Credit card fraud and scams like substituting inferior goods for those that were actually bought are common. You should remain vigilant and alert to potential confidence tricks.</p>\n\n<p>When visiting the medina quarter of a town or city, make sure any guide you use is operating with the agreement of the local tourist authorities, and displays an official badge. Harassment of tourists by people posing as official tourist guides is common.</p>\n\n<p>Women should exercise caution particularly when travelling alone as they could be vulnerable to unwanted attention or harassment by men.</p>\n\n<p>Exercise caution when travelling to Morocco for a relationship initiated via the internet.

In 2018, 3,485 people were killed and approximately 100,000 injured in traffic accidents. The road fatality rate is approximately 9 times higher than in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Drive carefully, especially in poor weather conditions, on secondary routes and on mountain roads. Driving at night can be particularly hazardous due to poor lighting. Lorries and trucks may be overloaded and you should take extra care around them. It\u2019s common to encounter pedestrians crossing motorways. You should take extra care when overtaking, particularly where there is no hard shoulder. Leave plenty of time to reach your destination and respect speed limits.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a road accident, you should complete a \u2018Constat Amiable\u2019 form, to be signed by both parties. Blank forms are available on arrival at Tangier port from the insurance company booths and from tobacconists in all cities.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a road accident resulting in a fatality and the Moroccan authorities consider you responsible, you may be detained pending a trial hearing.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter Morocco with a vehicle, the registration number will be recorded. If you\u2019re not in possession of the same vehicle when leaving Morocco, you\u2019ll be refused exit and detained. You\u2019ll need to provide evidence of adequate motor insurance.

This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps in the wider region are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers.
