Its main objective is to protect foreigner safety and security in case of an emergency during their stay in Cambodia. Registration applies to all foreigners present in Cambodia, including tourists and residents. 
 The Immigration Department has clarified that registration is the responsibility of the host (landlords/hotel owners) not of the foreign resident/tourist. Foreigners will not face any fine if they are not registered, but will not receive their visa extension until the landlord/hotelier has input the foreigners details in the system. 
 We advise that you check with your host to confirm that they have registered you on the app, and if not, then to ask them to do so. 
 If you have no landlord/own your own home, you would need to register yourself.

 Entry to Georgia 
 Foreign citizens are not currently allowed to enter Georgia, apart from citizens or residents of five EU Member States (France, Germany, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) who arrive by direct flight. The ban also applies to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. 
 There are two work-related schemes for foreign citizens from other countries to enter Georgia: 
 
 
 Business trips by citizens of any country will be allowed if a permit is obtained. If applicable, you should  complete the relevant form  to apply for entry. 
 
 “Work from Georgia” scheme is available to citizens from 95 countries, including the UK, who want to work from Georgia remotely. If applicable, you should  complete the relevant application form . Conditions apply, including a minimum salary level of $2,000 a month, the ability to pay Georgian taxes, and health insurance. 
 From 15 September, all foreign arrivals will be obliged to take a coronavirus PCR test on arrival, followed by a mandatory 8-day quarantine and a PCR test on the 8th day. If this test is negative, you will be able to leave quarantine but will have to take another PCR test on the 12th day.  Those on a business trip will have the option to take a PCR test every 72 hours instead of quarantine.  Tests and quarantine will be at your own expense. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage. For those with access to their own accommodation in Georgia it may be possible to self-isolate at home. If you wish to do this you will need to  fill in the relevant form  in advance. A call centre will be active communication with foreign nationals arriving in Georgia for the duration of their stay. 
 The government has announced that it is postponing the re-opening of Georgia’s land and air borders, as well as international tourism until at least 1 October. 
 Entry permits and extensions 
 The Georgian authorities recognise that some non-Georgian residents may be unable to renew their entry permits in due time due to border closures. The Government has announced that foreigners legally in Georgia up to 14 March but then unable to leave because of COVID-19 can remain until 31 December 2020 if their overstay was caused by one of the following circumstances, which must be documented: 
 
 if the state of citizenship of the person was included in the high risk zone for the relevant period 
 if border restrictions were imposed by the relevant state 
 if the person was in hospital, quarantine or self-isolation due to health conditions 
 if the person was not able to leave the country due to flight cancellation 
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed the British Embassy that if you were legally in Georgia by 14 March and wish to renew your stay without applying for a residence card, you will need to  book an appointment at a Public Service House . 
 You should attend your appointment with a Georgian-speaker if needed as you will need to make your renewal application and be interviewed in Georgian.  Your application must include the reason why you could not renew your visa in time or renew it on-line during the State of Emergency.  The fee is 50 lari (approx. £13).  The Public Service House will review the case and make a decision within three days on whether, and if so, for how long to renew your visa. 
 If you meet the requirements to apply for a Georgian Residence Permit such as working or studying, you can book an appointment at a Public Service House to start the procedure. 
 If you are in Georgia for more than 183 days and take up any form of paid employment, you are automatically liable for income tax and must inform the Revenue Service of your employment, whether you have registered as officially resident or not. Non-compliance will be fined. 
 UK passports 
 In consideration of the difficulty of renewing UK passports during coronavirus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that the Georgian authorities will recognise the validity of the following UK passports for residence and visa purposes until the UK Government informs otherwise: 
 
 a UK passport that has expired since 6 January 2020 or has less than six months’ validity when presented to Georgian authorities will now be recognised as expiring on 31 December 2021  The UK Government has confirmed that it will continue to recognise any British national holding such passports as British under international law 
 these amendments apply to those holding the following passports - British Citizen, British National (Overseas), British Protected Person, British Overseas Citizen and British Subject 
 The recognition of UK passport extensions only applies where you need a valid passport to reside in Georgia or when applying for an appropriate visa or residence permit. 
 If your passport has expired and you need to leave Georgia, you will need to apply for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD) through the British Embassy in Tbilisi.  ETDs meet international standards for travel documents which are set by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and guarantees British nationals will be allowed to travel by airlines and other transport providers and by national authorities.

 Entry to Germany 
 There are now no general COVID-19-related restrictions on entry into Germany from elsewhere in the EU, the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway. Entry restrictions and heightened checks on Germany’s borders for those arriving by land or air from these countries expired on 15 June. For Spain, the restrictions on entry (by air) were lifted on 21 June. 
 The German Interior Ministry has confirmed that travellers from the UK are no longer required to demonstrate a valid reason in order to enter Germany. Standard German entry and immigration rules in place before the COVID-19 outbreak apply. 
 Entry into Germany from third countries (outside the EU/EEA and the UK) 
 In line with the European Commission recommendation, from 2 July Germany is gradually lifting restrictions on entry from third states where the COVID-19 epidemiological situation is improving. The rules concern travellers’ place of immediate prior stay, not their nationality. 
 On 2 July Germany lifted restrictions on entry for travellers coming from the following countries: Australia, Georgia, Canada, Montenegro, New Zealand, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. Restrictions will also be lifted for entry from South Korea, China and Japan if this can be agreed on a reciprocal basis. Currently Germany has not yet lifted restrictions on entry from Serbia, Morocco, Algeria and Rwanda, on the basis of infection data provided by its own public health institute, although these four countries were included on the European Commission list. The list will be reviewed every two weeks. 
 Entry from any third country is possible for travellers who can demonstrate an important reason for their travel. The list of important reasons covers German and EU citizens and any third-country nationals with a right of residency in Germany. It also includes healthcare and social care personnel and health researchers, skilled workers whose economic activity is necessary and cannot be postponed or performed from abroad, freight and transport staff, seasonal workers, students who cannot continue their studies from abroad, travellers making visits for urgent family reasons, diplomats and staff at international organisations, and persons transiting Germany. 
 Transiting Germany 
 It remains possible for British citizens (and all EU/EEA citizens) to transit via Germany in order to go home or to their place of habitual residence. 
 You should ensure you are aware of your airline’s policy on protective measures on board flights; some carriers have made the wearing of face masks compulsory, for example. 
 The Federal Ministry of the Interior has detailed information on its  website, including in English , regarding the rules on entry and exit from Germany. 
","
 The German Interior Ministry has encouraged federal states to revise their quarantine regulations for arriving and returning travellers. People entering from other EU countries, the Schengen area and the UK will only have to go into quarantine if they are entering from an area where there is a high rate of infection. Travellers should consult local federal state and health authority guidance for specific arrangements (see  Federal Interior Ministry FAQs ) 
 Since 8 August travellers entering Germany after staying in a designated risk area abroad during the previous 14 days must undergo mandatory testing for Covid-19.  The German government regularly updates its list of designated risk areas. See the English archive at the bottom of this  Robert Koch Institute link  for the latest list. 
 If you’re travelling to Germany and have been in a designated risk area, there are three choices.  You can: 
 
 present a valid test taken within 48 hours prior to arrival; 
 take a test directly on arrival - there are facilities to provide such testing operating at airports and major transport hubs; or 
 take a test after your return to your place of residence in Germany, where you are required to report to the local health office.  The test is free of charge if taken within 72 hours of arrival. 
 A negative test may exempt you from the 14-day self-isolation requirement, but you should note that some German states require a second negative test before granting an exemption from quarantine.

 Entry to Greece 
 British nationals are not affected by the European Union’s measures to close EU borders to non-EU country nationals. If you’re a British national, you can still enter Greece, but you must comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements, including on testing and self-isolation. 
 Greece’s air connections with Turkey are currently closed to passenger traffic. If you are travelling by air from Bulgaria, Malta, Romania or the United Arab Emirates, and, from 17 August, from Albania, Sweden, Czech Republic, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands or North Macedonia, you may be denied entry to Greece unless you can show a negative coronavirus result from a test conducted no more than 72 hours before your arrival. 
 From 17 August, all travellers entering Greece by any land border are required to produce a COVID-negative PCR test conducted in the country of departure within 72 hours of arrival in Greece.  This applies equally to Greek nationals and Greece residence permit holders. 
 You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. 
 The land border with Bulgaria is open at the Promachonas crossing point. 
 All other land borders (including those with Albania, North Macedonia and Turkey) are subject to restrictions. From 7 August, all border crossings except the Promachonas crossing with Bulgaria will be shut down each night between 11pm and 7am. Outside these hours, you may cross into Greece at other border points only for essential reasons. From 16 August, if you enter Greece from Albania, including via the Kakavia land border, you must complete a Passenger Locator Form and quarantine for 7 days at the address you provide on the form.  As of 16 August, the number of travellers entering Greece through the Kakavia crossing is limited to 750 persons per day. 
 Keep an eye on changes to border arrangements on the Greek authorities’ relevant  webpage . 
 You must wear a face mask at all times when on an aeroplane or ferry travelling to or from Greece; and whilst at airports. 
 Passenger Locator Form 
 You must  complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF)  at least 24 hours before your arrival in Greece. Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter the country. 
 Every traveller, including children, must have their details included on a Passenger Locator Form (PLF). If you’re travelling with others outside of your household, you should all complete your own form. If you’re travelling together as a household, the Greek authorities ask for you to complete one form with all adults and children included. You can add additional members of your household at the top of the form before you submit. 
 However, some airlines may require individual PLFs for every traveller over the age of 18 within the same household. You should check directly with your airline what you will need to show in order to be allowed boarding. Remember that you will need to complete PLFs at least 24 hours before your flight. This is a requirement whichever way you travel to Greece (including by ferry, road, rail or air). The form is in English. 
 Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email acknowledgement. In a separate email, you will also receive a QR code. This code is likely to be sent up to 24 hours before you travel, regardless of how early you fill in your form. When you receive your code, make sure you either print it, or can show it on your mobile phone. 
 If you are travelling by air to Greece, your airline will ask you to prove that you have completed the PLF form. You should print or show (e.g. on your phone) your email confirming submission of the form (or the QR code you have subsequently received). Failure to do so could result in you being refused boarding to the flight. 
 If you are travelling by ferry to Greece, the ferry operator will ask you to complete an additional form (‘Pre Boarding Information’), alongside your PLF. This additional form will be provided by the ferry operator, either via their website, or at booking offices: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing. 
 On arrival in Greece by land, sea or air, you will need to show your QR code to the Greek authorities. Make sure you have either a printed copy of the code, or can show it on your phone. Failure to provide your PLF form/ QR code will result in a fine or you may be refused entry to Greece. 
","
 When you arrive in Greece, the Greek authorities will scan your QR code and may require you to undergo testing for coronavirus, as part of health screening. The Greek authorities’ instructions will differ according to whether you arrive by land, sea or air. Check the requirements that will apply to you on the  PLF form page . 
 Any passenger entering Greece may be asked to undergo a test, but you are more likely to be asked if you have arrived from a country outside of the EU (including the UK), either directly or via indirect flights. 
 If you are required to take a test on arrival: 
 
 After testing you should practise social distancing and self-monitor for symptoms that could indicate COVID-19. The Greek authorities will contact you if you test positive and advise you on whether you need to self isolate or quarantine.  Test results are expected to become available within 24 hours 
 if your test result is positive, the Greek authorities are likely to ask you to self-isolate for 14 days. Depending on the nature of your accommodation (e.g. whether you’re staying in a hotel, or in a private property like a house or villa), you may be required to move to government-provided accommodation. If you’re asked to move, the costs of transfer and your new accommodation will be paid by the Greek authorities 
 If you are not required to take a test on arrival, you will not be required to self-isolate. 
 You must comply with all instructions given by the Greek authorities. Failure to do so may result in you being refused permission to enter Greece and/or legal enforcement. 
 You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight subsequently test positive, you may be subject to further quarantine/self isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements.

 The Slovenian authorities have implemented a Red, Amber, Green list to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia. The UK is currently on the Green List. Full details can be found on the  Ministry of the Interior website . 
 Anyone arriving from a country on the  Green List  and who has not visited or transited through a country on the Red List, will not be required to enter into quarantine on arrival. 
 From Sunday 13 September, anyone arriving from a country on the  Red List  will be required to enter into 10 day quarantine on arrival, unless they meet one of the exemptions listed below. 
 For travellers arriving from countries that are on neither the Green nor the Red List, restrictions will be imposed if you are not a Slovene Citizen nor hold permanent or temporary residence in Slovenia. 
 Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you. 
 If you are travelling from a country on the Amber or Red list, you will not be required to undertake a 10-day self-isolation period on arrival in Slovenia if you satisfy one of the exemptions below. Some of these exemptions also require travellers to have a negative coronavirus test, no more than 3 days old. Exemptions from quarantine include: 
 
 People transiting Slovenia while traveling to another country within 12  hours after the entry: 
 People with diplomatic passports; 
 People who provide services for which they have been issued a certificate by the competent ministry and if imposing a quarantine could result in major social or economic damage due to the non-provision of these services; (with a negative coronavirus test, no more than 36 hours old) 
 workers in international transport. 
 A full list of the exemptions can be found on the  Slovenian Government website 
 All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border, regarding the steps they may need to take.

 The Ukrainian government has not outlined any changes to the quarantine requirements in addition to the closure of the border to most categories of foreigner. Therefore, if you are among the groups permitted to enter Ukraine, the country from which you are travelling will dictate whether or not you are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Ukraine. 
 Travellers arriving from countries in what the Ukrainian authorities call the “green zone”, are not required to undergo self-isolation or observation on arrival. 
 Travellers arriving from countries in what the Ukrainian authorities call the “red zone”, are required to undergo 14 days’ self-isolation proven by the  “Dii Vdoma” tracking app , or quarantine in a Government-approved facility for 14 days upon arrival. 
 Mandatory self-isolation or quarantine is not necessary if a traveller undergoes a PCR test and receives a negative result no more than 48 hours in advance of his/her arrival in Ukraine, or once in Ukraine.  Further information about taking the tests in Ukraine and terminating self-isolation in case of a negative result can be found via the ‘more detailed’ link of the ‘for citizens of “red zone” countries’ box on the Ukrainian authorities’  Visit Ukraine webpage . 
 Citizens of “red” countries who can prove that they have spent the last 14 days in “green” countries are treated as arriving from the “green zone”, and will not be required to isolate.  Individuals whose travel originated in a “green” country but who have visited a “red” country prior to arriving to Ukraine (for example, those travelling by car transiting “red” countries) may be required to self-isolate or quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. Mandatory self-isolation or quarantine is no longer necessary if a traveller undergoes a PCR test and receives a negative result no more than 48 hours in advance of his/her arrival in Ukraine, or once in Ukraine. 
 Currently, the UK falls into the “green zone”. Check the  list of red and green zone countries  by clicking the “more detailed” links in the “for citizens of green/red zones” information boxes. The red and green zone lists are updated frequently and can change quickly in response to the epidemic – you should check the lists regularly. 
 Children under the age of 12, drivers and crew members of cargo vehicles, buses, train, locomotive, aircraft, sea and river vessels are also not required to undergo self-isolation or quarantine, provided they have not been in contact with a person with COVID-19. 
 Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine can be completed at your chosen address using the “Dii Vdoma” mobile app. You need to have a Ukrainian mobile phone number with the SIM card activated before you arrive in the country, though the SIM does not need to be in your phone on arrival. When using the app, you must respond promptly to notifications sent to your mobile (in Ukrainian). 
 More information about the app is available on the  Cabinet of Ministers website  or the  Visit Ukraine webpage . Make sure that you understand the regular reporting requirements before taking up this option. People who do not register with the  Dii Vdoma app , or who do not abide by its terms, are required to complete quarantine at a government-approved observation centre. 
 Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.

There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on case by case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices.

 There is no requirement for testing on departure though anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates.

 If you want to stay in Vietnam, you should only do so legally and with the right visa and permission to stay. Immigration offices are open and working normally. 
 Vietnamese visit visas are issued to foreign nationals for a limited duration and on the basis that visitors must leave on or before the date of expiry. Those who come to Vietnam to work are required to apply for a work visa / permit. You should check the visa validity and conditions carefully. Overstaying your Vietnamese visit visa is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid, and may be prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future. 
 The Vietnamese authorities have announced that foreigners who entered Vietnam from 1 March under the visa waiver program, e-visa or visit visas can remain in Vietnam until 30 September. 
 The Embassy and Consulate General will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations. For those with a valid work visa or resident cards, you can extend these at immigration offices with the assistance and support of your family or employer.

 Quarantine is mandatory for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus inside Vietnam and for most coming to Vietnam for 14 days or more. There are special arrangements for those coming to Vietnam for less than 14 days and which will be decided on a case by case basis. Vietnamese government quarantine centres are basic. Most do not meet Public Health England standards. In principle there are provisions for people who are exceptionally allowed to enter the country for work to be allowed to undertake quarantine in a hotel approved by the Ministry of Health. However, this is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam. 
 The Vietnamese government has confirmed that anyone entering Vietnam from 1 September 2020 must pay for quarantine costs both in government centres and in designated hotels. You will also be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs. 
 Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed or assist in the reservation of, or transfer to, hotels used for quarantine. Violations carry strict penalties. 
 Quarantine lasts a minimum of 14 days and could be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Following discharge you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. You should expect to be tested at least 5 times prior to release, and will be required to produce 3 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and a further two consecutive negative tests during self-isolation. 
 Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam. 
 Vietnam uses community testing as a means to provide assurance that COVID-19 is not being transmitted undetected. Should you be asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
