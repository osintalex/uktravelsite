 Foreigners Registration 
 The Interior Ministry’s General Department of Immigration announced that it will DENY VISA EXTENSIONS for foreigners who are not registered on the Foreigners Present in Cambodia System (FPCS) by 1 July 2020. The FPCS will be used to record and manage foreigners’ information when they arrive at any entry point and record their data when they leave Cambodia. Its main objective is to protect foreigner safety and security in case of an emergency during their stay in Cambodia. Registration applies to all foreigners present in Cambodia, including tourists and residents. 
 The Immigration Department has clarified that registration is the responsibility of the host (landlords/hotel owners) not of the foreign resident/tourist. Foreigners will not face any fine if they are not registered, but will not receive their visa extension until the landlord/hotelier has input the foreigners details in the system. 
 We advise that you check with your host to confirm that they have registered you on the app, and if not, then to ask them to do so. 
 If you have no landlord/own your own home, you would need to register yourself. 
 The FPCS app is free to download on  iOS  and  Android . There is a video tutorial from the General Department of Immigration on how the app works (although the video has Khmer narration, the images are with English text:  FPCS Video Tutorial 
 The in-app tutorial is in English. There are 6 steps for registration:

 If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline. 
 Screening on arrival 
 Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international airports) have put in place measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Arriving passengers are required to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate prior to entry. Additional screening may include temperature measurements, completing a health screening questionnaire and answering questions from health officials. This will include checks on recent travel to affected areas and your accommodation details for your self-isolation (see Quarantine requirements below). 
 Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and  will be tested. Any person that tests positive for COVID-19 will be prohibited from entering Ethiopia. 
 Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. 
","
 All passengers arriving into the country (except diplomats) are required to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate, dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) . Only RT 2PCR tests will be accepted. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight. 
 All passengers will be subject to 7 days mandatory self-isolation. You must provide the address for your self-isolation upon arrival. 
 Diplomats are encouraged to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate. Where they do so, they will need to self-isolate at their residence for 7 days. Where they do not present a negative test certificate, they will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. 
 Land border quarantine 
 Measures are in place when arriving into the country across land borders. 
 Those crossing with a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) will be screened for symptoms and required to self-isolate at home for 7 days. Those that do not present a negative test certificate will be screened and required to self-isolate for 14 days. Only PCR tests will be accepted. 
 Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and a further test. The standard of isolation centres varies significantly around the country. 
 You should check for the latest information with local authorities before travelling to the border.

 Entry to Georgia 
 Foreign citizens are not currently allowed to enter Georgia, apart from citizens or permanent residents of five EU Member States (France, Germany, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) who arrive by direct flight. UK citizens who wish to enter Georgia under this scheme will need to provide evidence of their permanent residence status at the airport.  The ban also applies to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. 
 There are two work-related schemes for foreign citizens from other countries to enter Georgia: 
 
 
 Business trips by citizens of any country will be allowed if a permit is obtained. If applicable, you should  complete the relevant form  to apply for entry. 
 
 “Work from Georgia” scheme is available to citizens from 95 countries, including the UK, who want to work from Georgia remotely. If applicable, you should  complete the relevant application form . Conditions apply, including a minimum salary level of $2,000 a month, the ability to pay Georgian taxes, and health insurance. 
 You can find further information on current entry rules on the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs website . 
 Most foreign arrivals will be placed in mandatory 8-day quarantine, followed by an antigen rapid test.  If the antigen test is inconclusive, this will be followed by a PCR. If this test is negative, you will be able to leave quarantine but will have to take another PCR test on the 12th day. Those on an approved business permit have the option to take a PCR test every 72 hours instead of quarantine. Tests and quarantine will be at your own expense. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage. 
 For those with access to their own accommodation in Georgia it may be possible to self-isolate at home, rather than enter a quarantine hotel designated by the health authorities. If you wish to do this you will need to  fill in the relevant form  in advance. A call centre will be in active communication with foreign nationals arriving in Georgia for the duration of their stay. 
 The government has announced that the re-opening of Georgia’s land and air borders is postponed until at least 1 November, and that the tourism sector won’t be relaunched in 2020. 
 Entry permits and extensions 
 The Georgian authorities recognise that some non-Georgian residents may be unable to renew their entry permits in due time due to border closures. The Government has announced that foreigners legally in Georgia up to 14 March but then unable to leave because of COVID-19 can remain until 31 December 2020 if their overstay was caused by one of the following circumstances, which must be documented: 
 
 if the state of citizenship of the person was included in the high risk zone for the relevant period 
 if border restrictions were imposed by the relevant state 
 if the person was in hospital, quarantine or self-isolation due to health conditions 
 if the person was not able to leave the country due to flight cancellation 
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed the British Embassy that if you were legally in Georgia by 14 March and wish to renew your stay without applying for a residence card, you will need to  book an appointment at a Public Service House . 
 You should attend your appointment with a Georgian-speaker if needed as you will need to make your renewal application and be interviewed in Georgian.  Your application must include the reason why you could not renew your visa in time or renew it on-line during the State of Emergency.  The fee is 50 lari (approx. £13).  The Public Service House will review the case and make a decision within three days on whether, and if so, for how long to renew your visa. 
 If you meet the requirements to apply for a Georgian Residence Permit such as working or studying, you can book an appointment at a Public Service House to start the procedure. 
 If you are in Georgia for more than 183 days and take up any form of paid employment, you are automatically liable for income tax and must inform the Revenue Service of your employment, whether you have registered as officially resident or not. Non-compliance will be fined. 
 UK passports 
 In consideration of the difficulty of renewing UK passports during coronavirus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that the Georgian authorities will recognise the validity of the following UK passports for residence and visa purposes until the UK Government informs otherwise: 
 
 a UK passport that has expired since 6 January 2020 or has less than six months’ validity when presented to Georgian authorities will now be recognised as expiring on 31 December 2021  The UK Government has confirmed that it will continue to recognise any British national holding such passports as British under international law 
 these amendments apply to those holding the following passports - British Citizen, British National (Overseas), British Protected Person, British Overseas Citizen and British Subject 
 The recognition of UK passport extensions only applies where you need a valid passport to reside in Georgia or when applying for an appropriate visa or residence permit. 
 If your passport has expired and you need to leave Georgia, you will need to apply for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD) through the British Embassy in Tbilisi.  ETDs meet international standards for travel documents which are set by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and guarantees British nationals will be allowed to travel by airlines and other transport providers and by national authorities.

 If you’re travelling to Germany from the UK or an EU/EEA country, you no longer need to demonstrate a valid reason to enter Germany. Standard German entry and immigration rules in place before the COVID-19 outbreak apply. 
 If you’re travelling to Germany from a country outside the UK or EU/EEA, you will also not need a valid reason for travel if you are a British or EU/EEA national or long-term resident (this also applies for any core family members travelling with you). Guidance for other travellers is available on the  German Federal Police website  (in German). 
 However, if you’re travelling to Germany from an area  designated as presenting an increased risk of infection , you will need to follow the rules on testing and quarantine on arrival, as set out below. The UK is currently designated as an increased risk area. 
 The Federal Ministry of the Interior has detailed information on its website,  including in English , about the rules on entry and exit from Germany. 
 Travel from increased risk areas 
 If, in the two weeks before you travel to Germany, you have been in an area  designated as presenting an increased risk of infection , you must: 
 
 take a COVID-19 test 
 
 notify the local German health authority  in your place of residence/accommodation 
 travel directly to your accommodation and quarantine for 14 days (unless and until you are advised that you do not need to do so - see below) 
 The UK is currently designated as an increased risk area. The full list of areas can be found in English on the  Robert Koch Institute website . 
 There are three choices to get a test. You can: 
 
 present a valid test taken within 48 hours prior to arrival, in a European Union member state (or a state with comparable quality standards) 
 take a test when you arrive - there are testing facilities at airports and major transport hubs that provide tests free of charge 
 take a test after you return to your place of residence in Germany, where you are required to report to the local health office. The test is free of charge if taken within 72 hours of arrival 
 A negative test exempts you from the 14-day self-isolation requirement in most German states. A small number of states require a second negative test before granting an exemption from quarantine. Individual states are responsible for the implementation of quarantine regulations and local rules may vary.

 If you’re a British national, you can enter Greece, but you must comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements, including the completion of a Passenger Locator Form before you travel, and other testing and self-isolation requirements. Read this section of the travel advice in full to check how these requirements apply to you. 
 You must wear a face mask at all times when on an aeroplane or ferry travelling to or from Greece; and whilst at airports. 
 Passenger Locator Form 
 You must  complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF)  at least 24 hours before your arrival in Greece. The form is in English, and is required whichever way you travel to Greece (including by ferry, road, rail or air). Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter the country. 
 Every traveller, including children, must have their details included on a PLF. If you’re travelling with others outside of your household, you should all complete your own form. If you’re travelling together as a household, the Greek authorities ask for you to complete one form with all adults and children included. You can add additional members of your household at the top of the form before you submit. 
 Some airlines may require individual PLFs for every traveller over the age of 18 within the same household. Check directly with your airline what you will need to show to be allowed boarding. Remember that you will need to complete PLFs at least 24 hours before your flight. 
 Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email acknowledgement. In a separate email, you will also receive a QR code. This code is likely to be sent up to 24 hours before you travel, regardless of how early you fill in your form. When you receive your code, make sure you either print it, or can show it on your mobile phone. 
 If you are travelling by air to Greece, your airline will ask you to prove that you have completed the PLF form. You should print or show (e.g. on your phone) your email confirming submission of the form (or the QR code you have subsequently received). Failure to do so could result in you being refused boarding to the flight. 
 If you are travelling by ferry to Greece, the ferry operator will ask you to complete an additional form (‘Pre Boarding Information’), alongside your PLF. This additional form will be provided by the ferry operator, either via their website, or at booking offices: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing. 
 On arrival in Greece by land, sea or air, you will need to show your QR code to the Greek authorities. Make sure you have either a printed copy of the code, or can show it on your phone. Failure to provide your PLF form/ QR code will result in a fine or you may be refused entry to Greece. 
","
 When you arrive in Greece, the Greek authorities will scan your QR code and may require you to undergo testing for coronavirus, as part of health screening. The Greek authorities’ instructions will differ according to whether you arrive by land, sea or air. Check the requirements that will apply to you on the  PLF form page . 
 Any passenger entering Greece may be asked to undergo a test for COVID-19, but you are more likely to be asked if you have arrived from a country outside of the EU (including the UK), either directly or via indirect flights.

 The Greek authorities are likely to ask you to quarantine until you are advised otherwise. You may be required to move to government-provided accommodation until your test result is available. If you’re asked to move, the costs of transfer and your new accommodation will be paid by the Greek authorities. The nature of your accommodation may differ from the specifications of your pre-booked hotel, villa or other place of stay. Depending on local arrangements and capacity, travellers in groups may be required to stay in separate accommodation 
 If your test result is negative, the Greek authorities will inform you, and you will be free to move to your pre-booked accommodation, unless the authorities have other reasons to require you to continue your quarantine. For example, if you have tested negative but contact tracing suggests you have been in proximity to someone else who has tested positive, you may be asked to continue quarantining for a further period (likely to be 14 days; or, with the agreement of the authorities, 8-10 days followed by certification by a medical professional that you are free of COVID-19 (you may be required to pay any costs related to medical treatment/ certification)). Following completion of any quarantine, you should continue to follow all coronavirus-prevention guidance from the local authorities, including on social distancing. 
 If your test result is positive, the Greek authorities are likely to ask you to quarantine  for 14 days, or until the date of your departure from Greece. You may be required to remain in government-provided accommodation for the duration of this self-isolation period. 
 If you are not required to take a test on arrival, you will not be required to self-isolate. 
 You must comply with all instructions given by the Greek authorities. Failure to do so may result in you being refused permission to enter Greece and/or legal enforcement. 
 You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight subsequently test positive, you may be subject to further quarantine/self isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements. 
 Restrictions on entry by air 
 Greece’s air connections with Turkey are currently closed to passenger traffic. Air connections with other countries and regions are liable to suspension or amendment, sometimes at short notice. If you are due to fly to or from Greece, you should contact your airline or operator for the latest information. 
 All travellers visiting Greece by air from Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, the United Arab Emirates, Malta, Belgium, Spain, Russia,Albania and North Macedonia, will be allowed admission into Greece only by presenting a negative COVID-19 test carried out within 72 hours before arrival. Travellers from these countries will also be subject to sample testing upon arrival. 
 Restrictions on entry by land borders 
 From 17 August, all travellers entering Greece by any land border are required to produce a COVID-negative PCR test conducted in the country of departure within 72 hours of arrival in Greece. This applies equally to Greek nationals and Greece residence permit holders. 
 You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. 
 The land border with Bulgaria is open at the Promachonas crossing point. 
 All other land borders (including those with Albania, North Macedonia and Turkey) are subject to restrictions. From 7 August, all border crossings except the Promachonas crossing with Bulgaria will be shut down each night between 11pm and 7am. Outside these hours, you may cross into Greece at other border points only for essential reasons.

You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. 
 From early in the pandemic many countries in the region closed their borders. That meant that only Barbados had direct flights to the United Kingdom. The High Commission have previously managed to facilitate charter flights to connect with such flights.

Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination.  They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). 
 Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. 
 Testing / screening on arrival 
 All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) and to undergo quarantine for 14 days. All individuals regardless of nationality who show coronavirus symptoms on arrival will be tested. Those who test positive will be isolated and treated at a hospital or community treatment centre. 
 For those not showing symptoms on arrival, Korean nationals, and long term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, may self-quarantine at home. Arrivals from the USA and Europe must receive a test within three days; arrivals from elsewhere must receive a test within 14 days. 
 All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days on arrival.

 If you display symptoms or return a positive test result for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.

 Entry to Vietnam 
 Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas and the entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on a case by case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices. The requirements and process may differ from province to province. The costs of quarantine, both in government centres and designated hotels, must be paid by those arriving or their employers. 
 Land borders 
 Borders with China, Cambodia and Laos are currently closed except for the import and export of goods. 
 Transiting Vietnam 
 Currently transit in Vietnam is not allowed. 
 Data collection 
 Those arriving in Vietnam are required to provide information about recent travel. 
 Testing on departure 
 There is no requirement for testing on departure though anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates. 
 Visas 
 If you want to stay in Vietnam, you should only do so legally and with the right visa and permission to stay. Immigration offices are open and working normally. 
 Vietnamese visit visas are issued to foreign nationals for a limited duration and on the basis that visitors must leave on or before the date of expiry. Those who come to Vietnam to work are required to apply for a work visa / permit. You should check the visa validity and conditions carefully. Overstaying your Vietnamese visit visa is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid, and may be prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future. 
 The Embassy and Consulate General will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations. For those with a valid work visa or resident cards, you can extend these at immigration offices with the assistance and support of your family or employer. 
 Passport validity 
 Your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months on the date you enter Vietnam. 
 A number of British nationals have been refused entry and exit due to their passport being damaged. Make sure your passport is  in good condition  before arriving in Vietnam.  Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport. 
 In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Vietnamese Immigration Department has received assurances from the British Government that any passport held by a British national with an expiry date of 1 January 2020 onwards, or with less than 6 months validity, would be valid until 31 December 2021, when submitted for the purpose of renewing a visa or residence permit. This continues to be valid for all passports held by British nationals. However, because you can  renew your passport online , and the visa application centres in Vietnam have now reopened, we still recommend that you renew your passport if required.

 Quarantine is mandatory for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus inside Vietnam and for most coming to Vietnam for 14 days or more. There are special arrangements for those coming to Vietnam for less than 14 days and which will be decided on a case by case basis. Vietnamese government quarantine centres are basic. Most do not meet Public Health England standards. In principle there are provisions for people who are exceptionally allowed to enter the country for work to be allowed to undertake quarantine in a hotel approved by the Ministry of Health. However, this is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam. 
 The Vietnamese government has confirmed that anyone entering Vietnam from 1 September 2020 must pay for quarantine costs both in government centres and in designated hotels. You will also be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs. 
 Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed or assist in the reservation of, or transfer to, hotels used for quarantine. Violations carry strict penalties. 
 Quarantine lasts a minimum of 14 days and could be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Following discharge you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. You should expect to be tested at least 5 times prior to release, and will be required to produce 3 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and a further two consecutive negative tests during self-isolation. 
 Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam. 
 Vietnam uses community testing as a means to provide assurance that COVID-19 is not being transmitted undetected. Should you be asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
