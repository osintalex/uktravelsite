The correct IDP is the one issued in accordance with the 1968 UN Convention on Road Traffic. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Montenegro. You can get the IDP over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you bring your own or a rented vehicle into the country, you must have the original vehicle registration/ownership documents and a locally valid insurance policy with you. If you fail to carry the right documents, you will be refused entry and the car may be impounded until you can prove ownership. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot assist you in confirming the validity of photocopied and/or emailed registration logbooks (V5C) nor obtain originals for you.</p>\n\n<p>Check if your insurance provides <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cobx.org/\">European Green Card</a> vehicle insurance valid in Montenegro.

In particular, the two-lane Moraca Canyon in Montenegro can be dangerous when conditions are poor and there is overcrowding. Roads leading to Montenegro\u2019s coastal areas are in better condition, but can be overcrowded during the summer season.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n<p>By law you must wear a seatbelt. Riders of scooters, mopeds or motorcycles must wear a crash helmet.</p>\n\n<p>You must drive with dipped headlights on during the day and must not use a mobile phone while driving. You must equip your car for winter conditions when the weather requires it.</p>\n\n<p>Montenegrin traffic law defines intoxication as a blood alcohol level higher than 0.3 g/kg, or 0.1 g/kg for drivers younger than 24 or with less than 12 months of driving experience.</p>\n\n<p>Exceeding the speed limit by just 10kph will get you a fine in Montenegro, while excessive speeding (30kph over the limit in towns and 50kph on motorways) and overtaking under dangerous conditions will lead to automatic confiscation of your driving licence. Fines for traffic offences range from \u20ac20 to \u20ac6,000. Prison sentences can also be imposed.</p>\n\n<p>If you are issued with a fine, the issuing police officer will usually request payment is made to a bank account within a reasonable time. In certain circumstances your passport may be seized. If you deny the charge you have the right to appear in court. All fine receipts have serial numbers and can be monitored in a central register for 3 years.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a small traffic accident, you can request a police investigation at a cost of 50 euros. This fee is reimbursable from the person found guilty for causing the accident after completion of the court proceedings. Drivers can opt to complete a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cartraveldocs.com/european-accident-statement\">European accident report</a> and submit it to their insurance company without a police investigation.</p>\n\n<p>The only toll in Montenegro is the Sozina tunnel between Lake Skadar and the sea.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-and-adventure-sports\">Extreme and adventure sports</h2>\n\n<p>A wide range of outdoor activities are on offer for tourists. Take precautions to prevent injuries and use protective equipment. Before signing up with paragliding instructors, for example, ask to see their training licence for tandem flights. Make sure you have a correct licence when renting vehicles, particularly jet skis. Take particular care when hiking in the Montenegrin mountains. Do not underestimate the hike: factors like weather, landscape, distance and elevation can increase the risks. Ask your guide about the required hiking equipment according to landscape and season; take fully charged mobile phone and enough supplies with you.</p>\n\n<p>If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>In early 2020 there were a series of largely peaceful protests over a new law on religion, which caused some disruption and road closures. These protests began again in May, and have involved altercations between police and protesters. Resulting disturbances have been unpredictable in nature, with some clashes with police and the closure of some roads for a number of hours as a result of protests.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been sporadic disturbances across the country since a political dispute in mid-June in the coastal town of Budva involving public demonstrations and confrontations with police.</p>\n\n<p>Following the recent Parliamentary elections on 30 August 2020, there have been large gatherings in the capital and other cities. You should exercise caution, keep up to date with local developments, check local media and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.

Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you are concerned about whether or not it is safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you are travelling to, together with information from other sources you have identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it is safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we will state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you have booked, you should contact your travel company.
