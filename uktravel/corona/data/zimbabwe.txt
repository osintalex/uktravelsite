People travelling alone may be more vulnerable. Mugging, pick pocketing and jewellery theft are common in city centres, especially after dark. Street lighting can be poor.

You should be particularly vigilant when using these routes. Keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed. Be careful at night and at filling stations. Don\u2019t leave your vehicle unattended in unguarded areas in towns.</p>\n\n<p>Carry your Zimbabwean residents\u2019 ID or a photocopy of your passport at all times.

Safety standards vary and you should check whether operators are trained and licensed. There have been a number of incidents in which animals have attacked visitors, resulting in injuries and, in some cases, death. Some activities, such as walking or canoe safaris, could pose risks to personal safety. You should treat wild animals with caution and respect and keep a safe distance from them at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Flash flooding during the rainy season (November to April) can make some roads impassable.</p>\n\n<p>Zimbabwe is currently experiencing severe electricity shortages resulting in extended periods without power. During blackouts, you should exercise a high degree of caution when driving as traffic lights may not be operational. Water rationing is being experienced in certain parts of the country. Contact your tour operator or hotel for latest updates.</p>\n\n<p>There are sometimes power cuts as well as occasional fuel and water shortages. The Zimbabwean mobile phone network and land lines are unreliable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rural-areas\">Rural areas</h3>\n\n<p>Since 2000 most of Zimbabwe\u2019s commercial farms have been occupied or taken over by members of the National War Veterans\u2019 Association and others. Farm invasions continue, sometimes accompanied by violence and threats. Take care when visiting farming areas that you are not familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>The diamond mining area in Marange is a restricted area. If you are stopped and told that you may not access a particular area, you should turn back.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Zimbabwe using a full UK driving licence for up to 12 months. If you\u2019re a resident in Zimbabwe you may wish to get a Zimbabwean licence to minimise the potential for problems at road blocks. Make sure you have your personal documents such as your passport and visa at all times. You\u2019ll also require a police vehicle clearance certificate (temporary import permit) if you\u2019re bringing in a non-Zimbabwe registered vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>You must obey police signals, stop at roadblocks and toll-gates and produce identification if asked to do so.

If you see the motorcade, pull off the road or onto the side of the road if this isn\u2019t possible. There have been a number of incidents where people have been assaulted by the security forces for stopping in the wrong place or for not stopping soon enough.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic accidents are a common cause of death and injury in Zimbabwe. There are often deep potholes in the roads. Traffic lights are often out of action. You should avoid driving outside the main towns at night. Vehicles and roads are often poorly lit and roads badly marked. Abandoned unlit heavy goods vehicles, cyclists without lights, pedestrians and stray livestock are particular hazards. Emergency services may provide very limited help in the event of an accident and ambulances are often delayed.</p>\n\n<p>Travel carefully on inter-city roads, always wear seatbelts, lock car doors and carry a comprehensive medical kit. Be careful about stopping at lay-bys, particularly in the Beitbridge area, as there have been incidents of cars being robbed and occupants attacked.</p>\n\n<p>Plan carefully before setting out on long distance journeys. Availability of fuel is sporadic and queues are common, so either carry extra fuel or top up your tank whenever possible. You are advised to check in advance if you can make payment with an international payment card. Seek up-to-date local advice about any places that you plan to visit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>Public transport is currently very limited. Public transport and services are unreliable. Commuter omnibuses or \u201ccombis\u201d are often overcrowded, inadequately maintained, uninsured and recklessly driven. You should avoid them if possible. Larger intercity buses may also be poorly driven. There have been a number of serious road accidents involving long distance buses travelling at night.</p>\n\n<p>Major hotels usually have their own taxis which can be used safely for local city travel.  Taxis recommended by hotels are usually reliable and in good condition.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>The rail system is underdeveloped and very poorly maintained.

Following the passage of a new constitution in 2013, this legal position has been subject to some debate and the Constitutional Court recently ruled that some categories of dual nationality were in fact legal, and Zimbabwean citizens by birth have been permitted to hold dual nationality.

Same-sex marriage is explicitly prohibited by the 2013 constitution. However, there is a small but active underground gay scene in Harare and prosecutions are rare.

There\u2019s a shortage of drugs and trained medical staff in hospitals, making it difficult for hospitals to treat certain illnesses including accidents and trauma cases. The shortage of fuel has reduced emergency response capabilities. Private clinics will not treat patients until they pay and often require large amounts of cash before they will admit even emergency cases. An increasing number of businesses in Zimbabwe will only accept US dollars in cash, rather than credit or debit cards. This includes some medical providers.  Even if payment is available some of the best hospitals are often too full to admit patients. Medical costs, particularly for evacuation, can be high. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re on medication, bring sufficient supplies of your medication to cover the period of your stay.
