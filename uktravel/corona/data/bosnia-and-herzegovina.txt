Be vigilant and make sure personal belongings including your passports are secure. Excessive displays of wealth, including large quantities of cash or jewellery and luxury vehicles can make you a target for opportunist thieves. Make sure your vehicle is locked and your belongings are out of sight. Take particular care in areas popular with foreign tourists, locals and in crowded public venues. Report all incidents of crime to the local police station and get a written report. Local police don\u2019t always have English language skills and you may need the services of a translator.</p>\n\n<p>Authorities have warned citizens of a new scam taking advantage of the coronavirus issue, whereby criminals pose as disinfectant officials to gain access to properties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain from the 1992-95 war. Highly populated areas and major routes are clear of mines and are safe to visit, but you should take special care near to the former lines of conflict. Although roads themselves may be clear on major routes, there are many landmines close to the edge of roads. Don\u2019t stray from roads and paved areas without an experienced guide. Unless you have an experienced guide, you should avoid the open countryside and especially destroyed or abandoned buildings, neglected land, un-tarred roads, woods and orchards, private property and abandoned villages. Abandoned buildings, even in towns and cities may be booby trapped with mines. For further information, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bhmac.org/?lang=en\">Mine Action Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>English is not widely spoken. Local rail, bus and tram services are generally reliable if sometimes slow. Official taxis in Sarajevo and the major towns are well-regulated and metered. Taxi drivers from the Republika Srpska might be unwilling to drive to a destination in the Federation, and vice versa. Don\u2019t use unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina using a valid UK driving licence or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>, in accordance with the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, during short visits of up to 6 months. If you\u2019re staying longer than 6 months you will need to get a local driving licence. Bosnian authorities will retain your UK or any other foreign driving licence when applying for a Bosnian one. You cannot exchange an International Driving permit for a Bosnian licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re driving through Bosnia and Herzegovina to another country, make sure you have the right documentation for your destination. Further advice can be found on the relevant Foreign Travel Advice page.</p>\n\n<p>You need valid insurance to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina in a vehicle. If you don\u2019t have the correct insurance, you\u2019ll need to buy border insurance when you enter the country. The border police should be able to direct you to the insurance company office at the border crossing. Euros are accepted, but credit card payment is not always possible.</p>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t buy border insurance at all <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.granpol.gov.ba/popup/?cid=37,2,1\">border crossings</a>. The border police advise travellers to use the recently upgraded crossings at: Bijaca, Crveni Grm (south), Zubci (south-east), Karakaj and Raca (east), Samac (north-east), Kamensko and Izacici (west).</p>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t buy border insurance at the Neum border crossing. If you\u2019re entering Bosnia and Herzegovina via Neum, you should be able to buy insurance at the Doljani border crossing.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have original vehicle registration and ownership papers with you as border guards, customs or the insurance company may want to see them.</p>\n\n<p>Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bhembassy.co.uk\">Bosnia and Herzegovina Embassy in London</a> if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle in to the country. The British Embassy won\u2019t be able to help if you don\u2019t have the correct documentation on arrival at the border.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling outside the main towns and cities, especially in winter when road conditions can worsen quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Between 15 November and 15 April you are legally required to use winter equipment on your vehicle. This means:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>all tyres must have an MS, M+S or M&amp;S mark and a stylised symbol of a snowflake; the tread should be at least 4 mm deep</li>\n  <li>snow chains should be carried as their use is compulsory in winter conditions\u00a0or if the relevant sign is displayed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You must drive with dipped headlamps at all times, not just after dark.  Take great care when driving at night as many roads are badly lit or have no lighting at all. Avoid long-distance travel at night. Take care when overtaking and when approaching traffic lights as local drivers have a habit of braking suddenly when traffic lights change to amber. If you are involved in an accident, stay at the scene until the police arrive. The police may breathalyse those involved. Traffic police can impose on the spot fines for any traffic offence.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/touring_tips/bosnia-herzegovina.pdf\">AA</a>\u00a0and<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/countries/bosnia-herzegovina/\">RAC</a> guides on driving in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Sarajevo (Butmir) International airport is prone to fog from October to March and particularly during December and January. If you are travelling into or out of Sarajevo during winter, make sure you have enough money if you are forced to extend your stay, as many airlines won\u2019t take responsibility for accommodation due to delays caused by adverse weather.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adventurous-activities\">Adventurous activities</h3>\n\n<p>Check that your travel and medical insurance cover you for any adventure activities and sports.</p>\n\n<p>Diving off Mostar bridge can be dangerous and there have been reports of serious injuries and even fatalities when imitating the professionals.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls. Currents can be extremely strong.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>There are occasional protests in major towns and cities. These are normally peaceful but can cause disruption to traffic and limit access to public buildings. Keep up to date with developments, be vigilant and avoid all protests.</p>\n\n<p>There is a small risk of isolated violence linked to the return of displaced persons or the arrest of war crimes suspects. This can occur without any warning anywhere in the country.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
