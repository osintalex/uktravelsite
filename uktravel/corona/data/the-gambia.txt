Be polite but firm in refusing unwanted help or attempts at conversation. Visitors should also be wary of offers, usually from \u2018bumsters\u2019, to take them on tours into Senegal.

They will process your application on your behalf. The same procedure is also applicable for International Non-Governmental Organizations, United Nations Agencies, and other diplomatic missions in the Gambia.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are bad and roads severely potholed. Driving after dark carries added hazards because of poor road and vehicle lighting. In the event of an accident, emergency medical facilities are very limited.
