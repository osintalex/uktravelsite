Clashes along the Saudi-Yemeni border continue, resulting in both military and civilian casualties.</p>\n\n<p>Missiles, unmanned aerial systems (drones) and water borne IEDs continue to be launched against Saudi Arabia, targeting critical national infrastructure, including aviation interests and oil infrastructure. Many of these have been intercepted and destroyed by Saudi air defence systems.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks against critical national infrastructure are likely. Abha International Airport (Asir province) had been the target of a number of attacks, resulting in injury to civilians and the death of one. On 14 September 2019, Aramco facilities, Abqaiq and Khurais, were hit by drones and missiles.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks may be made on other locations in Saudi Arabia, including Riyadh and Jeddah, and along the Red Sea coast. There have been 9 intercepted missile attacks over Riyadh since the first missile attack on 4 November 2017, the most recent on 10 September 2020. In the event of a missile attack, you should stay indoors, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.

All air and sea points of entry between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were cut on 6 June 2017. If you have a query relating to travel plans, contact your airline or tour operator. There are further restrictions on travel and residence affecting Saudi Arabian and Qatar nationals.

Attacks can be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. On 11 November 2019, a terrorist carried out a knife attack on artists performing on stage during Riyadh Season Festival, injuring four people. Opportunistic attacks on Saudi or western targets are also possible. You should be vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation interests.

For more information and advice about what items you can take into the cabin on your flight from Saudi Arabia to the UK, contact your airline or travel company.</p>\n\n<p>On 22 June 2020, the Saudi authorities announced that, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pilgrims from outside the Kingdom would not be permitted to enter Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj in 2020. Hajj rites were only performed by a very limited number of pilgrims who already reside in the Kingdom. A temporary suspension on Umrah for overseas pilgrims remains in place. The Saudi authorities have announced plans to gradually allow pilgrims to perform Umrah at limited capacity. British nationals resident in Saudi Arabia can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.haj.gov.sa/en/InternalPages/Details/107\">apply to perform Umrah through the official Ministry of Hajj app</a>.
