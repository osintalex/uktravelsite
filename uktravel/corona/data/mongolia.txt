There have been isolated incidents of rape and murder of foreign nationals. Petty crime is common, particularly in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. Watch out for pickpockets especially in markets or other crowded public places. Be wary of large groups of people, including children and teenagers, who sometimes harass pedestrians for money when entering and leaving vehicles, pubs and restaurants. Tourists\u2019 mobile phones are especially targeted by thieves in the streets and should be carried securely. Keep passports, money and other valuables in a safe place and don\u2019t display signs of wealth \u2013 jewellery etc.</p>\n\n<p>Incidences of violent crime do occur in Ulaanbaatar and there have been reports of foreigners being robbed and assaulted, especially when walking alone at night, or using unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Petty crime tends to increase during festive months \u2013 New Year, Tsagaan Sar (December \u2013 February) and Naadam (July). Take - safety precautions at all times but especially during these months and when using Public Transport.</p>\n\n<p>Report any theft to the nearest district police station. The police can provide a letter for insurance purposes. In an emergency call the police on 102 or +976 102 from an international mobile phone. There should be someone available on this number who can speak to you in English.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling across the Mongolian countryside can be difficult and potentially dangerous if you are not familiar with the terrain. Mongolia does not have an extensive road network. You may need to follow tracks in the dust, mud or sand and there will not necessarily be other traffic to follow if these give out. Global Positioning Systems do not always function reliably and there are areas of the country without mobile phone coverage. We recommend that you take back-up communications like a satellite phone with you, plenty of water and provisions. Make a contingency plan and make sure someone knows your route and times of arrival and departure.</p>\n\n<p>Mongolia experiences extremes of weather, from +35C in summer to -40C in winter. Even in summer, evenings can be cold because of the altitude and weather conditions can change without warning. There are very long distances between settlements. Take appropriate provisions, including warm clothing, blankets, food and water if you are travelling outside urban areas.  You should carry a First Aid kit and supply of prescription medicines when travelling outside Ulaanbaatar. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mongolia/health\">health</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards have not kept pace with the dramatic growth in the number of vehicles and are highly variable. Vehicle maintenance can be poor, even for rental vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Wear seat belts where possible and avoid driving at night. If possible, use an experienced, professional driver familiar with the driving conditions. Driving in Ulaanbaatar is hazardous as roads are heavily congested. There is minimal signposting and a high number of accidents.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to drive in Mongolia you need an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html\">International Driving Permit.</a>. You should also try to familiarise yourself with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.traffic-institute.mn/\">local law.</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"communications\">Communications</h3>\n\n<p>Most UK phone networks work in cities but the network isn\u2019t widely available in remote areas. Wifi is available in many restaurants and bars and you can buy local SIM cards and mobile phones at a reasonable price.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Evidence suggests that domestic services (including helicopter services) in Mongolia do not always comply with international safety standards. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010 the International Civil Aviation Organisation <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a>, evaluating Mongolia\u2019s safety oversight capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=MT\">Aviation Safety Network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Flights can be subject to disruption due to weather conditions and maintenance issues. Bear this in mind when making your travel plans.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Trans-Mongolian express trains (Beijing-Moscow via Ulaanbaatar) are known to be used for smuggling. Search your compartment and secure the cabin door before departure. Do not pack something in your luggage or transport any items for someone else.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>In recent years there have been occasional instances of civil and political unrest resulting in demonstrations and in some cases violence.

Foreigners who aren\u2019t residents of Mongolia haven\u2019t always been able to get Chinese visas from the Chinese embassy in Ulaanbaatar.

Once registered you will be issued with a residence permit. The permit will include your date of birth, passport number, address, photograph and fingerprints. You should carry it with you at all times when you are in Mongolia.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors who have been in Mongolia for more than 90 days must obtain an exit visa to leave the country. The exit visa is obtained from the Mongolian Immigration Agency office and usually takes 10 days to process. Visitors to Mongolia for less than 90 days do not need an exit permit. However, requests to exit Mongolia can be denied for reasons such as civil disputes, pending criminal investigations or immigration violations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"emergency-travel-documents\">Emergency Travel Documents</h3>\n<p>You can only use a UK Emergency Travel Document (ETD) to enter Mongolia if you\u2019re a permanent resident or for airside transit. ETDs can be used to exit Mongolia. If your ETD has been issued in Mongolia and you are a permanent resident in Mongolia, you\u2019ll need an exit visa from the Immigration Authority. If you don\u2019t have a residence permit you won\u2019t need an exit permit to exit Mongolia on an ETD.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-crossings\">Border crossings</h3>\n<p>There are normally 8 border points open to British passport holders. They are at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar, the road/train crossing to China at Zamin Uud, the road crossing to China at Bulgan in the west, the road crossing to China at Bichigt in the south east, the road crossing to Russia at Tsagaannuur in the far west, the train crossing to Russia at Sukhbaatar and the road crossings to Russia at Altanbulag and Ereen-Tsav. You may not cross into China or Russia at any of the other border points as they are either seasonal or are open only to Mongolians, Chinese or Russians.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to bring a vehicle into Mongolia at any of the border crossings you should inform the tax authorities and border troops in advance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling by train across the China/Mongolia border expect a delay of a few hours as the railways use different gauges.</p>\n\n<p>You may encounter problems when entering Mongolia by train from Russia, particularly with Russian border or customs officials who scrutinise documentation (in particular customs declarations) very carefully. If you are crossing overland to or from Russia pay scrupulous attention when completing all the necessary paperwork.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-mongolia-by-car\">Entering Mongolia by car</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Mongolia by car you should familiarise yourself with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.mn/en/2012-03-14-03-21-37/2012-03-14-03-22-33/278-regarding-the-regulations-and-procedures-to-cross-motor-vehicles-through-the-mongolian-border\">Mongolian Customs law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Mongolia in a private vehicle you should complete the customs declaration form and make sure you have all valid vehicle documents, including driving licence, ownership records and insurance. You can complete the customs declaration forms on entry at the border, as well as at the Ulaanbaatar City Customs Office situated next to the train station in Ulaanbaatar.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter Mongolia in a private vehicle you must leave in the same vehicle, or otherwise pay customs tax. The amount of tax depends on the size of the engine and the value of your vehicle. You can find more details on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.mn/en/k2-items/2014-03-25-01-12-56\">Mongolian Customs\u2019 webpage</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle breaks down in Mongolia, you won\u2019t be able to leave it there without paying customs tax. If your vehicle breaks down and can\u2019t be fixed you must either pay for it to be transported out of Mongolia, or sell it on to a local mechanic, but you\u2019ll still need to pay customs tax. You mustn\u2019t under any circumstance leave your vehicle unattended or abandon it.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re leaving your vehicle in Mongolia you must leave it in a secure place, either with a mechanic or at an official Customs warehouse, for which you will need to submit a completed customs declaration form and pay a monthly fee for storage. If you leave your vehicle with a mechanic in Mongolia because it can\u2019t be fixed, you must provide proof (photos and a letter from a mechanic and a police report) of this to the Customs Office. If you choose to sell your vehicle, you\u2019ll need to show proof of sale.</p>\n\n<p>Customs tax is payable in local currency (MNT) only and must be paid directly to the Customs Office. If you wish to leave your vehicle and then return to collect it at a later date you should still pay the tax up front, which can then be reimbursed to you when you return to take your vehicle out of Mongolia. If you aren\u2019t able to return in person, ask a third party to make the initial tax payment, and then collect the refund on your behalf.</p>\n\n", "slug": "entry-requirements", "title": "Entry requirements"}, {"body": "\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p><strong>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Mongolia on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/151/mongolia#COVID-19\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See the healthcare information in the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mongolia/coronavirus\">Coronavirus section</a> for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Mongolia.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> on the TravelHealthPro website.

For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-pollution\">Air pollution</h2>\n<p>The high levels of air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, especially in winter, may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the pollution index levels for many cities on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aqicn.info/city/ulaanbaatar/us-embassy/\">aqicn.info</a> website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>There have been isolated incidents of bubonic plague in some rural areas of Mongolia. Plague is caught by consuming marmot meat. The meat is a delicacy in some rural areas although it is illegal to hunt for marmot in Mongolia. When travelling in rural areas, you should avoid marmot meat and follow the latest advice from the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you have been exposed to Bubonic Plague whilst travelling in Mongolia, you should immediately report to the nearest hospital and call the National Infectious Disease Centre on +976 100. You should contact the British Embassy if you or your group is quarantined due to an incident involving Bubonic Plague.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h2>\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as possible to inform them of what has happened.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of healthcare is variable, especially outside Ulaanbaatar. In Ulaanbaatar the quality and access can also vary. Doctors and hospitals may ask for cash payment in advance of treatment. The quality of local medical supplies is low and some medicines are counterfeit. Take basic supplies of over-the-counter medicines and any regular prescription drugs you may need with you.</p>\n\n<p>Medical bills, especially when medical evacuation is required, can be very substantial. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n", "slug": "health", "title": "Health"}, {"body": "<p>Mongolia is very much a cash-based society.
