You should remain vigilant and avoid any demonstrations, monitor local media for up-to-date information and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Most visits to Ghana are trouble free, but criminal activity does occur and can range from incidents of petty crime to opportunistic crime, to violent crime such as robbery, burglary and serious assault that can include the use of weapons. Take sensible precautions. Avoid carrying large sums of money or valuables, use a hotel safe whenever possible and be particularly vigilant when withdrawing cash from ATMs.</p>\n\n<p>Take care at public beaches and avoid going to the beach on your own. Theft is the main problem, but there have been isolated incidents of violent crime and sexual assault in areas popular with tourists.</p>\n\n<p>Theft of luggage and travel documents occurs at Kotoka International Airport and in hotels. Make sure your passport is secure at all times and don\u2019t leave baggage unattended. Be wary of offers of help at the airport unless from uniformed porters or officials. All permanent staff at the airport wear an ID card showing their name and a photo. ID cards without a photo are not valid. If you are being collected at the airport, confirm the identity of your driver by asking for ID. British nationals have been robbed by impostors who have approached them before the main arrivals area pretending to be their driver.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in street crime in Accra. If you\u2019re visiting Accra you should be vigilant, particularly at night. Avoid travelling alone and where possible try not to walk to and from destinations. There have been cases of violent robberies involving foreign nationals who have been attacked and robbed at gun point.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in petty crime, like pick pocketing, bag snatching and opportunistic theft on certain roads in Accra. The main areas of risk highlighted by the police are: Graphic Road, George Walker Bush Highway, Accra Mall Roundabout, Awudome Cemetary Road, Pokuase-Amasaman Road, Teshie-Nungua road, Labadi beach area and the Kokrobite beach area. You should be especially vigilant in these areas; keep windows up and vehicle doors locked.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re unlucky enough to be caught up in an armed robbery, you should immediately comply with the attackers\u2019 demands. Those who have suffered injury or worse during such attacks have been perceived as not complying fully or quickly enough.</p>\n\n<p>Most armed robberies occur at night though some incidents have happened during daytime. Be vigilant and drive with doors locked.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you lock windows and secure accommodation both at night and before you go out. There have been cases of burglaries in areas used by the international community living overseas, including Airport Residential, Cantonments, Ridge and Kokrobite.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports in the media of criminally-motivated kidnapping in Accra, Takoradi, and Kumasi, including targeting foreign nationals. Kidnaps can be for financial or political gain, or can be motivated by criminality. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam\u00a0artists operating in West Africa. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/types_of_fraud\">scams come in many forms</a> - romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<p>If you or your relatives or friends are asked to transfer money to Ghana you should make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it. If the caller claims to be in distress, you should ask whether they have reported the incident (by phone or e-mail) to the British High Commission in Accra.</p>\n\n<p>If you have sent money to someone you believe has scammed you and are contacted by a police officer for more money to help get your money back, then this is possibly another part of the scam. Scam artists have also been known to use the identity of officials at the British High Commission in Accra. If you receive an email from someone claiming to be an official at the British High Commission, contact the officer using the phone numbers or contact details for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/ghana\">British High Commission</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>As a result of occasional local Chieftaincy, land disputes and political tension, isolated inter-ethnic violence and civil unrest can occur at any time; specifically but not exclusively in the Northern, Savannah, North East, Oti and Volta Regions.</p>\n\n<p>Localised outbreaks of civil unrest can occur at short notice, and can become violent (sometimes involving weapons). If you\u2019re in these areas, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities, If this does happen, local police may impose curfews to contain the situation. Curfews usually run from 7pm to 5am but these times can vary. The Interior Ministry may put out a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mint.gov.gh/category/press-release/\">press release</a>, you should check the website.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling in the Upper West or Upper East regions, keep up to date with developments in neighbouring countries, including through <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice.  There are often no physical barriers along Ghana\u2019s borders, and so the security situation in border areas could change quickly. Take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>Flooding is common in the Upper West, North East, Northern and Savannah regions during the rainy season (March to November). You should monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season.</p>\n\n<p>If you are transiting through Burkina Faso please read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso\">Burkina Faso travel advice</a></p>\n\n<p>In an emergency, visitors should contact Police on 191, and follow the advice of emergency services.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Ghana using an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> or a local driving licence.

If you\u2019re applying for a local driving licence from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.eservices.gov.gh/DVLA/SitePages/DVLA-Home.aspx\">Ghana DVLA</a>,\nyou must get your UK driving licence authenticated by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency\">UK DVLA</a>. You should carry your driving licence or International Driving Permit with you at all times when driving. An International Driving Permit is usually valid for a year and it cannot be renewed in Ghana.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are mainly in a poor condition, particularly in rural areas. Street lighting is poor or non-existent. Avoid travelling by road outside the main towns after dark, when the risk of accidents and robbery is greater. Grass or leaves strewn in the road often means an accident or other hazard ahead.  If you choose to drive at night be aware of impromptu police checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>Safety standards of taxi services in Ghana are often low. There have also been isolated incidents of crime taking place in all types of taxis (including licensed taxis, \u2018Tro Tros\u2019 and app-based taxi services). If you travel by taxi, we recommend you use licensed taxis, making sure to check driver IDs and the vehicle condition before you travel. Avoid travelling alone in taxis after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike official taxis, drivers and vehicles of \u2018Tro-Tros\u2019 and popular app-based taxi services are not centrally licensed. Driver training and vehicles standards will vary from those expected from similar service providers in the UK. Don\u2019t use \u2018Tro-Tros\u2019 outside the major towns and cities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.

The High Commission continues to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Ghana</p>\n\n<p>Around 90,000 British nationals visit Ghana every year. While most visits are trouble-free, crime does occur. In recent years, reported crime has increased, particularly over the Christmas period. Criminal activity ranging from petty street crime, to violent crime can occur at any time. Take sensible precautions. Be particularly vigilant in public areas, and take care when travelling by road. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/ghana/safety-and-security\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s mandatory for all foreign nationals resident in Ghana to register with the National Identification Authority (NIA) of Ghana and get a non-citizen Ghana card. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/ghana/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a></p>\n\n<p>Localised outbreaks of civil unrest can occur at short notice, and can become violent (sometimes involving weapons). If you\u2019re in these areas, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities. If this does happen, local police may impose curfews to contain the situation. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/ghana/safety-and-security\">Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Ghana. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
