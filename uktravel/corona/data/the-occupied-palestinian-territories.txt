Some of these protests have led to violent clashes. Stay alert at all times in the Old City and leave the area if there is evidence of tension or unrest (for example if the shops in the souks suddenly begin to close their shutters). The entrances to the Old City may be subject to checks or closures.</p>\n\n<p>Isolated street protests and demonstrations can also occur elsewhere in East Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of violent incidents on public transport and near public transport lines in Jerusalem, including the Light Rail network. You should avoid using buses in Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tel-aviv\">Tel Aviv</h3>\n<p>Take extra care when using public transport in Tel Aviv, in particular at transport hubs, and when using buses in the greater Tel Aviv area. You may wish to consider using other forms of transport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gaza\">Gaza</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to Gaza (including the waters off Gaza). You should not approach the perimeter fence surrounding the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can no longer offer routine consular assistance in Gaza. If you travel to Gaza you should review your security arrangements regularly and make sure you know what to do if you hear a warning siren.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is not able to support individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/entry-requirements#entering-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\">Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories</a></p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> recognises the need for major international organisations to carry out humanitarian and reconstruction work and to engage in independent reporting and verification of the situation on the ground in Gaza. Medical and other essential specialist staff should co-ordinate their entry to and exit from Gaza with those organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Do not attempt to enter Gaza by sea, including via a flotilla. The Israeli Navy routinely patrol the area and have made clear that it will prevent any vessels attempting to breach the restrictions. You will be detained and deported, and your electronic equipment is likely to be confiscated. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> does not believe that humanitarian supplies should be delivered in this way. Anyone wishing to send humanitarian assistance or other goods to Gaza should do so through established channels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"occupied-golan-heights\">Occupied Golan Heights</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to the east of Route 98 along the Syrian border.</p>\n\n<p>Rocket attacks and sporadic gunfire have occurred in northern Israel without warning since 2012. Although there has been a significant decrease since the military situation on the Syrian Golan stabilised in 2018, a residual threat remains. If you are travelling in the area, follow advice from local law enforcement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-lebanon\">Border with Lebanon</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to the Sheba\u2019a Farms and Ghajjar and within 500m of the border with Lebanon (the \u2018Blue Line\u2019) east of Metula, including the northern edge of the town. If travelling near areas of military operation, adhere to all Israeli official instructions.</p>\n\n<p>The situation on the ground could change quickly. On 1 September 2019 there was an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line, with material damage but no reported injuries on either side. You should keep up to date with the news and this travel advice while travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-egypt\">Border with Egypt</h3>\n<p>The security situation on the border with Egypt remains volatile. Take extra care and be vigilant when using Route 10 which runs along the Israeli border with Egypt and is subject to closures by the Israeli authorities. You may wish to consider using other routes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"west-bank\">West Bank</h3>\n\n<p>Expect road closures and numerous checkpoints across the West Bank. Travel in and out of the West Bank is not possible without passing through at least one Israeli military checkpoint. You will need a passport and immigration slip to go through these checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli authorities sometimes restrict movement in and out of the West Bank, either on Jewish High Holidays or as a result of a security incident. This doesn\u2019t normally affect foreign nationals, but would affect dual Palestinian-British nationals. Road closures can occur with little notice. You should keep up to date with local travel updates.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several violent incidents, particularly in the northern West Bank area (north of Tappuah) including throwing of stones and other objects on Route 60. There have been arrests of individuals carrying weapons in Nablus. You should be especially vigilant in this region.</p>\n\n<p>The cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jericho see large numbers of tourists including on organised tours and there have been no recent reports of any serious incidents involving foreigners. However, you should take care when travelling anywhere in the West Bank. Demonstrations and violent incidents can occur without warning particularly in areas close to refugee camps across the West Bank and in the cities of Jenin, Nablus and Hebron. You should avoid all demonstrations or large gatherings, including student protests.</p>\n\n<p>Israelis living in the illegal settlements in the West Bank occasionally organise demonstrations in the West Bank which sometimes turn violent. Take particular care if you are near any of these settlements, including those in the hills around Nablus and in the South Hebron hills. There is a closed military zone in the H2 area of Hebron (around Ash-Shuhada Street and the Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs), where there is a risk of a hostile reaction from members of extremist groups.</p>\n\n<p>There are also regular demonstrations against the route of the separation barrier in various locations including the villages of Bil\u2019in, Ni\u2019lin, Nabi Saleh, Jayyous, and Al Mas\u2019ara. These frequently turn violent. It is extremely dangerous to attend these demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>Due to a significant number of road traffic accidents involving taxis in the West Bank, you\u2019re advised not to use them where possible.</p>\n\n<p>Due to restrictions on travel, the ability of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> to provide consular assistance in the West Bank may be limited.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Most visits to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are trouble-free, but the theft of passports, credit cards, and valuables from public beaches is common. Keep your personal belongings in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Crime is generally not a problem in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, but you should take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-security\">Passport security</h2>\n<p>A Serious Organised Crime Agency investigation into the misuse of UK passports in the murder of Mahmud al-Mabhuh in Dubai in January 2010 found circumstantial evidence of Israeli involvement in the fraudulent use of British passports. This has raised the possibility that your passport details could be captured for improper uses while your passport is out of your control. The risk applies in particular to passports without biometric security features. Only hand your passport over to others (including Israeli officials) when absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Driving is erratic and there are frequent accidents.  Radar speed traps operate on roads within Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories, and fines for speeding are high.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to drive in the West Bank, check that you are insured before setting out. It may be easier to arrange West Bank insurance at a hire company in East Jerusalem than from the major hire car companies in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not safe to hitchhike in Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to the desert, go with others, take a supply of water and a mobile phone, and let someone know your itinerary and expected time of return.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Important\" class=\"advisory\">\n<p><strong>This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n<p>There is a risk of kidnap in Gaza and along the border with Egypt. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers.

If you attempt to drive into these areas local residents may throw stones at your car.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 12 April and finish on 11 May. During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset are forbidden for Muslims (though not for children under the age of 8). Although alcohol will be available in some hotels and restaurants, drinking alcohol elsewhere may cause offence. As a courtesy, you should avoid drinking, eating, and smoking in public places in the Occupied Palestinian Territories  during Ramadan. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/travelling-during-ramadan\">Travelling during Ramadan</a></p>\n\n<p>Be sensitive about taking pictures of people in Muslim and Orthodox Jewish areas.

Those caught in possession can expect a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults. Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but is illegal in Gaza, where it carries a 10 year prison sentence. Attitudes towards LGBT issues within some parts of society can be hostile. All public displays of affection, regardless of the gender or sexuality of those involved, may attract negative attention in more conservative areas. Homosexuality is largely taboo in Palestinian society.</p>\n\n<p>Tel Aviv has a large, active LGBT community and is famous for its annual Pride Parade. An annual Pride Parade is also held in Jerusalem, but there has been a heavy security presence at the event since a fatal stabbing occurred during the 2015 parade.

You must be able to prove you can enter isolation at home or another available dwelling in full compliance with the isolation guidance. If you are unable to do so, you will be sent to a state-sponsored hotel for isolation.</p>\n\n<p>You must not use public transport to travel to your dwelling, except a single-passenger taxi, provided you sit in the back of the taxi with the windows open.

On entry, visitors are granted leave to enter for a period of up to 3 months.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you\u2019re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal.</p>\n\n<p>It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, if you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.embassyofisrael.co.uk/\">Israeli Embassy in London</a>. If you work in Israel without the proper authority, you can be detained and then deported, a process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country\u2019s immigration policy or procedures.</p>\n\n<p>At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, as well as at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have on occasions used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states \u2018Palestinian Authority only\u2019 or \u2018Judea and Samaria only\u2019. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have also at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that he/she is not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless he/she obtains advance authorisation from the Israeli \u2018Territory Actions Co-ordinator\u2019, and that violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">Contact the Israeli embassy</a> if you need further information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n<p>Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"uk-emergency-travel-documents\">UK Emergency Travel Documents</h3>\n<p>UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories unless the holder is a returning resident.

It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.embassyofisrael.co.uk/\">Israeli Embassy in London.</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs-and-immigration\">Customs and Immigration</h3>\n<p>You should expect lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Electrical items, including laptops, may be taken from departing passengers for security inspection and either stored in the aircraft baggage hold, or returned to you in the UK. Damage may occur.</p>\n\n<p>If you arrive with valuable personal items (computers, camcorders etc.) you may be required to pay a deposit that is refundable on or after departure.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers\u2019 personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\">Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories</h3>\n<p>Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities.

The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is no longer able to provide administrative support for UK charities wishing to enter Gaza via the Rafah crossing.

You should be vigilant at all times and keep up to date with local media and travel reports. You should avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places frequented by foreigners, and on public transport. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There have been repeated instances of rocket fire from Gaza, which may occur well beyond the Gaza border area; Israel has often responded by returning projectile fire into Gaza. If travelling in central or southern Israel, familiarise yourself with the safety actions that you should take in the event of a warning siren, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/safety-and-security#gaza\">Gaza</a></p>\n\n<p>There are significant tensions between Israel, and the Assad regime and Iranian military forces in Syria. The situation remains fragile, with attempted and actual military exchanges either side of the border. If travelling in the area remain vigilant, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are also continued tensions between Israel and Lebanon.

These types of incidents also happen along Route 60 within the West Bank (the main road connecting Jerusalem with Nablus and Hebron) and along Route 443 between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There\u2019s a risk that tourists or bystanders could be caught up in any incident. You should avoid any demonstrations and follow instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Be especially vigilant and take great care at the Qalandiya checkpoint between East Jerusalem and Ramallah, in areas close to refugee camps, in and around Israeli settlements and in the cities of Jenin, Nablus and Ramallah. There have also been several violent incidents in the northern West Bank area (north of Tappuah). Individuals carrying weapons have been arrested in Nablus.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of increased tension around Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth) and after Friday prayers and on religious holidays.
