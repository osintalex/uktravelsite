Observe the speed limits. You should take extra care on minor roads and in rural areas where there are narrow roads and blind corners. Pedestrians often walk on the roads and indicators are not always used.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving at night as some roads are unlit. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving on the main road from Douglas Charles airport. This is prone to landslides following bad weather and has a number of sheer drops where the road has fallen away. Avoid driving on this road at night. Road signs are limited and a map is essential.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t stop if you\u2019re flagged down by pedestrians. Keep car doors locked when driving.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of an accident, call the police and don\u2019t move the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis aren\u2019t metered.
