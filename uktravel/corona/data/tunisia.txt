A new government formed by Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi was sworn in on 2 September. Demonstrations sparked by economic, political or religious tensions often occur. Most protests are peaceful, but some have affected key services, disrupted traffic or included violence, especially in Tunisia\u2019s south and interior. There have been recent protests, strikes and road blockages in El Kamour in Tataouine around an oil pumping station; in Gafsa close to phosphate-producing factories; and in the North-West of Tunisia and North Western suburbs of Greater Tunis, due to disrupted water supplies. More protests causing localised disruption are likely and may occur in other areas with little or no warning.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep up to date with developments, avoid all protests and places where large crowds gather and follow instructions given by the security authorities, your hotel and your tour operator, if you have one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n<p>There is a heightened Tunisian security presence at the borders with Libya and Algeria due to cross border terrorist activity and fighting in Libya. Border crossings are sometimes closed temporarily without notice.

The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to all other areas within 10km of Mount Mghila.</p>\n\n<p>Tunisian security forces continue to conduct operations. Security personnel have been killed and severely wounded in attacks and by booby-trap explosives in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Incidents of mugging, pick pocketing, bag-snatching and petty theft occur. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Where possible, avoid carrying all your important documents, money and other valuables in the same bag. You should remain alert to potential confidence tricks.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks are rare but they do occur. Harassment of foreign women, including uninvited physical contact, can sometimes occur. Women should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK and take care when walking or travelling alone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Tunisia with a valid <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> for up to one year. You will need to have a 1968 IDP to drive in Tunisia. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Tunisia. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Tunisia, it may be possible to drive on a UK licence for up to one year, providing that you meet a number of conditions and submit an application to the Tunisian Ministry of Transport. Please check the conditions and application process with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.attt.com.tn/page.php?code_menu=39\">Tunisian Ministry of Transport</a>. For any longer periods, you will need to apply for a Tunisian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards can be erratic. There is very little lane discipline and often confusion about the right of way, especially at roundabouts. There are few pedestrian crossings and traffic lights are sometimes ignored. Take care when driving in towns as pedestrians tend to walk on the roads and have the right of way. Take particular care when crossing roads on foot, even where there is a signal allowing you to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are generally of a reasonable standard although large pot-holes can appear quickly following heavy rain.</p>\n\n<p>You may come across military or police security checks. If you do, approach slowly, don\u2019t cross boundaries without permission and be prepared to present photo ID if asked.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations can occasionally affect road travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n<p>Rail travel is generally safe, although safety standards tend to be lower than those in the UK.

You should be vigilant at all times and follow the advice of local security officials, including in and around religious sites.</p>\n\n<p>Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should be particularly vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces\u2019 response times to an incident may vary.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation interests. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Tunisia to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.</p>\n\n<p>The main terrorist threat is from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Libya-based extremists with links to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). Despite some improvements in border security, Tunisia has a porous border with Libya, where there\u2019s a continuing conflict, an absence of security, and where Islamist terrorist groups operate. Tunisian security forces have repeatedly been targeted in terrorist-related incidents, mainly in border areas including in the Chaambi Mountains.</p>\n\n<p>Recent incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 6 September 2020, two officers of Tunisia\u2019s National Guard were attacked by three assailants in Sousse. They were run over by a vehicle then stabbed. One died in the attack. Security forces later killed all three attackers.</li>\n  <li>on 6 March 2020, a suicide bombing targeting a police patrol near the US Embassy in Tunis killed one police officer and injured four more, as well as a civilian.</li>\n  <li>on 14 October 2019, a French national was stabbed to death in Zarzouna, northern Tunisia, by an individual who then attacked a Tunisian soldier.</li>\n  <li>on 27 June 2019, there were 2 suicide bombings targeting security personnel in central Tunis; 3 people, including the perpetrators, were killed.</li>\n  <li>on 29 October 2018, 15 security personnel and 5 civilians were injured in a bombing on Avenue Habib Bourguiba in central Tunis</li>\n  <li>on 8 July 2018, militants attacked security forces near Ghardimaou, close to the Algerian border. A number of Tunisian National Guard officers were killed. This follows separate media reports in early July 2018 of Tunisian security forces disrupting a terrorist group in Hammamet</li>\n  <li>on 26 June 2015, 38 foreign tourists were killed, including 30 British nationals, in a terrorist attack at Port El Kantaoui near Sousse</li>\n  <li>on 18 March 2015, 21 tourists were killed, including a British national, in a terrorist attack at the Bardo Museum in the centre of Tunis</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Tunisian authorities regularly report that they have disrupted planned attacks and terrorist cells and made arrests. The Tunisian authorities have improved security in tourist resorts and their ability to respond to a terrorist incident. Tunisian security forces have also improved and are better prepared to tackle terrorist threats than they were at the time of the 2015 attacks. But further attacks remain likely, including in places visited by foreigners such as tourist resorts. Attacks may be carried out by individuals unknown to the authorities, whose actions may be inspired by terrorist groups.</p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time. Keep up to date with this travel advice, and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya, Mauritania and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.

It has been extended a number of times, most recently on 30 May 2020 effective until 30 November 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Since the terrorist attack in Sousse in June 2015, which targeted tourists, the UK government has been working closely with the Tunisian authorities to investigate the attack and the wider threat from terrorist groups. The Tunisian government has improved protective security in major cities and tourist resorts.</p>\n\n<p>On 6 September 2020 there was a terrorist attack on Tunisian National Guard officers in Sousse (Kantaoui). Government officials have confirmed that the perpetrators have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out further attacks in Tunisia, including against UK and Western interests. Security forces remain on a high state of alert in Tunis and other places. You should be vigilant at all times, including around religious sites and festivals. Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should be particularly vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces\u2019 response times to an incident may vary. Follow the advice of the Tunisian security authorities and your travel company if you have one. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations often occur in Tunisia and the majority are peaceful. However, you should avoid all areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests. Localised disruption, such as road blockages, are likely in the vicinity of protests and may occur with little to no warning. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can contact the emergency services by calling 197 (police - when in cities and towns), 193 (national guard - when in rural areas or small villages), 190 (ambulance) or 198 (civil protection - for assistance at incidents, such as car accidents, to provide medical assistance and response to fire).</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.
