Armed groups are present and intercommunal violence can affect political, security and humanitarian situation. There are continued reports of several towns in eastern DRC being attacked by or falling under temporary control of armed groups.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of attacks and kidnappings, including against staff from NGOs. In May 2018, 2 British nationals were kidnapped on the road north of Goma to Virunga National Park. They have since been released. There have been a number of reported attacks on Ebola responders working in affected areas.</p>\n\n<p>Following unrest in the Central African Republic, refugees have crossed the border into the DRC and are now in the Gemena area in Equateur Province.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of security incidents in Lubumbashi, most recently violent clashes involving a militia group in September 2020, and surrounding areas of Katanga, where the situation remains tense.</p>\n\n<p>You should be especially vigilant, consider travelling in convoy on trips outside Goma and Bukavu and avoid making any journeys that would involve travel after dark. Tourists in eastern DRC have been known to be left very vulnerable as a result of trying to travel independently without escorted transport, and the risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high.</p>\n\n<p>While British government staff do visit Goma, they aren\u2019t always in the area, and as with anywhere outside of Kinshasa the British Embassy\u2019s ability to offer consular assistance is severely limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert to the risk of street crime and armed robbery at all times. Foreigners are at particular risk of street robbery in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, especially near hotels and supermarkets in the centre of town. Robberies by gangs of street children are increasingly common and can be aggressive.</p>\n\n<p>Robberies by people posing as taxi drivers or taxi customers are common in Kinshasa, and are often accompanied by a threat of violence. You should avoid using any taxis in DRC. If you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one. Don\u2019t hail taxis on the street.</p>\n\n<p>Car jackings are rare but can occur.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of an increase in criminal activity in North and South Kivu specifically targeting the international community. There have been many reports of robberies and banditry in Goma after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t walk in the streets alone at any time, especially at night. Avoid displaying valuables and cash. Use a hotel safe if possible and keep copies of documents, including your passport separately.</p>\n\n<p>Some gangs use girls to lure people into traps; others promise cut-price gold and diamonds, or pose as police or security forces.</p>\n\n<p>There remains a risk of arbitrary arrests of foreigners by security authorities who demand payment for release.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local Travel</h3>\n\n<p>The border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu are liable to short notice closure.  You shouldn\u2019t rely on them as a point of exit from DRC.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re crossing regularly between Rwanda and DRC you may encounter immigration difficulties if you haven\u2019t regularised your residency status.</p>\n\n<p>The Ministry of Health in Rwanda has established new policies for travellers, including health care workers and humanitarian volunteers, wishing to enter Rwanda from Ebola-affected areas of DRC. You should check <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/rwanda\">travel advice for Rwanda</a> for further guidance.</p>\n\n<p>The borders with Burundi and Angola can also be subject to closure at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>You should be prepared to move at short notice or lock down for a period of time. The local authorities may impose curfews without warning. You should follow the advice of the local authorities at all times. In the event of escalating tensions and civil unrest, commercial flights may be suspended and borders closed. Keep your travel documents up to date so you can avoid facing difficulties should you need to leave in an emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"virunga-national-park\">Virunga National Park</h3>\n\n<p>The Nyiragongo volcano in Virunga National Park is active and has only limited access to tourists.</p>\n\n<p>The opportunities for gorilla trekking in the Virunga National Park in North Kivu are limited, and armed groups are sometimes active within the park. Tourists in eastern DRC have been known to be left very vulnerable as a result of trying to travel independently without escorted transport, and the risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> (IDP) to drive in the DRC. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in the DRC after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Car hire is possible in Kinshasa although self-drive options are limited. Most car hire companies will only rent a car with a driver.</p>\n\n<p>Driving conditions and standards are well below those in the UK and other European countries. Traffic accidents are common. Roads in Kinshasa are poorly maintained. Outside Kinshasa and other main cities, most roads are barely drivable even with a 4x4, especially during the rainy season (September to May). Consider the technical capability of your vehicle and be confident in your ability to safely operate it.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of vehicle theft and car-jacking. Lock vehicle doors and keep windows closed when driving and watch out for armed gangs who may target your car. Don\u2019t drive off the main routes or park in unsupervised areas.</p>\n\n<p>Security forces operate roadblocks, particularly after dark. If you are asked to produce documents for inspection at a check point, remain in your vehicle and show them through closed windows.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>The railways are in a dilapidated state and you should generally avoid rail travel.

This list isn\u2019t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">an audit</a> of the DRC\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority by the International Civil Aviation Organisation found that the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in the DRC was below the global average.</p>\n\n<p>UK government staff working in DRC are authorised to use aircraft operated by the Mission Aviation Fellowship for internal flights on a case by case basis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-travel\">River travel</h3>\n\n<p>The ferry service between Kinshasa and Brazzaville is operating, but is subject to cancellation at little notice. The ferry stops running in late afternoon, and there is no service on Sundays.</p>\n\n<p>Boats and ferries serving the rivers and lakes are poorly maintained and often overloaded. As a result of the low safety standards, high river traffic levels, strong currents, shifting sandbanks and poor maintenance there have been many accidents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>Political gatherings and demonstrations can be called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent in DRC. In July and August 2020 political protests took place in Kinshasa and throughout the country regarding electoral and judicial reform.</p>\n\n<p>A heavy United Nations peacekeeping presence is deployed in eastern DRC. The Congolese army is carrying out operations against foreign and domestic armed groups operating in North and South Kivu provinces. Large numbers of civilians remain displaced as a result of the conflict.

This has resulted in large numbers of children adopted by foreign nationals unable to leave the country, or their departure being delayed by more than 30 months. In May 2017 the DRC Senate adopted a law banning homosexual couples and trans-sexual couples from adopting Congolese children.
