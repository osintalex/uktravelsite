The violence is concentrated in specific areas, and some regions are almost completely spared. Make sure you research your destination thoroughly.</p>\n\n<p>Outbursts of politically-motivated violence can occur across the country, with a recent increase in the states of Guerrero and Mexico City.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"north-and-west\">North and west</h3>\n<p>Many fatalities are suspected gang members killed in turf wars between the different organisations that compete for control of trafficking routes into the US. Drug-related violence is a particular problem in the northern states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa and Durango. Armed clashes between security forces and drug groups can occur at any time without warning. You should take extreme care outside tourist areas in all of these states.</p>\n\n<p>You should take precautions in the state of Baja California, including Tijuana. There has been a rise in drug-related crime in Baja California Sur, including Los Cabos. You should take extra care when travelling to these areas.</p>\n\n<p>You should take care when travelling to Ciudad Juarez or other cities in Northern States. Travel during daylight hours when possible, inform relatives or friends of your travel plans and use reputable hotels only.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"east\">East</h3>\n<p>There have been reports of increased security incidents in the states of Tabasco and Veracruz. There has been a recent increase in violence in the State of Veracruz, including the city of Veracruz. Illegal roadblocks have also been reported more frequently. You should take extreme care.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"centre\">Centre</h3>\n<p>There have been reports of increased security incidents and drug-related violence in the state of Guanajuato. On 1st July 2020, 26 people were killed in the city of Irapuato. The majority of attacks have been attributed to organised crime. You should be extra vigilant in Guanajuato and surrounding areas.</p>\n\n<p>Criminal activity is also a problem in the State of Mexico (Estado de M\u00e9xico). You should take care when travelling through the state, as well as outside of tourist areas. There have been reports of armed robbery on public transport and vehicle theft on the highway. Petty crime is also common throughout the state.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"west-and-south\">West and south</h3>\n<p>Illegal roadblocks have been reported more frequently, particularly in the states of Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, Oaxaca and Chiapas. If you\u2019re driving in these states, travel during daylight hours and use toll roads where possible, although you may still encounter disruptions.</p>\n\n<p>There have been recent reports of clashes between cartels and local police in Michoac\u00e1n and Colima. In early 2020, two butterfly activists were found dead in the Monarch butterfly reserve in Michoac\u00e1n.</p>\n\n<p>Drug-related violence is also a problem in Guerrero, Jalisco and Nayarit. See the main tourist destinations section below for further details on these states.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"main-tourist-destinations\">Main tourist destinations</h3>\n<p>The Mexican government makes efforts to protect major tourist destinations like Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta and Nuevo Vallarta. These areas have mostly not seen the levels of drug-related violence and crime experienced elsewhere in Mexico. However, since 2017 there have been a number of reported shooting incidents and other incidents of violence in these areas, including in locations popular with tourists. There is currently an increased police presence in the Cancun area, including in the hotel zone. While tourists have not been the target of such incidents, anyone in the vicinity of an incident could be affected.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting any of these areas, you should monitor local advice, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities and your tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several instances of armed crime both within and outside tourist areas in Acapulco. If possible, travel by air if you\u2019re visiting a major tourist destination in Guerrero. Due to an increase in violent crime in recent months, you should be extra vigilant in Acapulco and surrounding areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Crime and violence are serious problems in Mexico and the security situation can pose a risk for foreigners. Many Mexican and foreign businesses choose to hire private security. You should research your destination thoroughly and only travel during daylight hours when possible. Monitor local media and inform trusted contacts of your travel plans.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the victim of a crime and wish to report the incident, you should do so immediately to the nearest branch of the state prosecutor\u2019s office (Agencia del Ministerio P\u00fablico). No criminal investigation is possible without a formal complaint to Mexican authorities. Complaints must be made in person before leaving Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>The emergency number in Mexico is 911. You can also download the 911 CDMX app (for Mexico City) or the Guest Assist App (for Quintana Roo).</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.caepccm.df.gob.mx/\">Mexico City Command and Control Centre</a> (Centro de Atenci\u00f3n a Emergencias y Proteci\u00f3n Ciudadana de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico) has information and advice in Spanish on safety in Mexico City.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport-and-driving\">Public transport and driving</h3>\n<p>When driving, avoid isolated roads and use toll roads (\u2018cuotas\u2019) whenever possible. Keep car doors locked and windows closed, especially at traffic lights. There have been a number of violent car-jackings and robberies along the Pacific Highway and you should be careful when travelling on this route. Those travelling in large camper vans or sports utility vehicles (SUVs) have been targeted in the past. If you suspect you\u2019re being followed or watched, drive to a police station or other safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Be particularly alert on public transport, at airports and in bus stations. Theft on buses is common so keep an eye on your belongings at all times. Buses have also been hijacked in conflict areas. Where possible, travel on first-class buses using toll roads, which have a lower rate of incidents than second and third class buses travelling on the less secure free (\u2018libre\u2019) roads. Most first-class bus companies perform security checks when passengers board the bus.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers have been robbed and assaulted by unlicensed taxi drivers including in Mexico City. In Mexico City, use the better regulated \u2018sitio\u2019 taxis from authorised cab ranks or ask your hotel concierge to order you a taxi. At airports, use only authorised pre-paid airport taxi services.</p>\n\n<p>Women travelling alone should be particularly alert when travelling on public transport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"street-crime\">Street crime</h3>\n<p>Street crime is a serious problem in major cities and tourist resort areas. Pick-pocketing is common on the Mexico City Metro. Dress down and avoid wearing expensive jewellery or watches. Limit the amount of cash or credit/debit cards you carry with you. Keep a close watch on briefcases and luggage, even in apparently secure places like the lobby of your hotel.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs or exchanging money at bureaux de change. It\u2019s generally safer to use ATMs during daylight hours and inside shops or malls.</p>\n\n<p>Be wary of people presenting themselves as police officers trying to fine or arrest you for no apparent reason. If in doubt, ask for identification and if possible note the officer\u2019s name, badge number, and patrol car number.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t leave food and drinks unattended in bars and restaurants. Travellers have been robbed or assaulted after being drugged. There have also been reports of tainted alcohol causing illness or blackouts. If you have any concerns, seek advice from your tour operator or the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Several serious sexual offences have also occurred in tourist areas outside of Mexico City. Take care even in areas close to hotels, and especially after dark.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams-and-virtual-kidnapping\">Scams and virtual kidnapping</h3>\n<p>Foreign visitors and residents may be targeted by scam artists. Be wary of strangers approaching you or contacting you by phone asking for personal information or financial help. If you or your relatives or friends are asked to transfer money to Mexico, make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it.</p>\n\n<p>The most common scam involves criminals phoning, acting as a distressed member of your family, or an employee, claiming to be kidnapped and demanding money for their release. Thieves may also deceive the family by assuring them that their relative is being detained. If you are threatened over the phone, the recommendation is to hang up and authenticate the safety of your family member or employee.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists have reported that some police officers have extorted money from them, for alleged minor offences or traffic violations. Travellers driving rental cars have also been targeted. If this occurs, do not hand over money or your passport, ask for the officer\u2019s name, badge and patrol car number and ask for a copy of the written fine, which is payable at a later date.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n\n<p>Short-term opportunistic kidnapping - called \u2018express kidnapping\u2019 - can occur, particularly in urban areas. Victims are forced to withdraw funds from credit or debit cards at a cash point to secure their release. Where victims have friends or relatives living locally, a ransom may be demanded from them. You should comply with requests and not attempt to resist such attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Longer-term kidnapping for financial gain also occurs, and there have been allegations of police officers being involved. Be discreet about discussing your financial or business affairs in places where you may be overheard by others.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Mexico using a UK licence or an International Driving Permit. Driving standards are very different from the UK. Roads can be pot-holed. Be prepared to stop unexpectedly and beware of vehicles moving slowly, changing lane without indicating and going through red lights. Many local drivers don\u2019t have any form of car insurance.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce air pollution, Mexico City and some other parts of the country have introduced restrictions on driving. Cars may be forbidden from entering certain areas on particular days, based on their number plates. These regulations are strictly enforced and offenders face heavy fines and temporary confiscation of their vehicle. This only applies to older vehicles and not to newer models which are often used for car hire. Please double check with your car hire company directly.</p>\n\n<p>There is an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sedema.df.gob.mx/sedema/\">additional driving restriction in Mexico City</a>, where vehicles without registration plates from the State of Mexico (Estado de Mexico) or Mexico City are not allowed to enter Mexico City from Monday to Friday between 5:00am and 11:00am, and Saturday between 5:00am and 10:00pm. If air pollution is high, generally between February and June, further driving restrictions may apply.</p>\n\n<p>In remote areas, you may come across unofficial roadblocks, including on main roads, manned by local groups seeking money for an unofficial local toll.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adventure-activities\">Adventure activities</h2>\n\n<p>If you take part in adventurous sports (including paragliding, skydiving, scuba diving and jet-skiing), make sure adequate safety precautions are in place. Equipment may not meet UK safety and insurance standards. Only use reputable operators, and satisfy yourself that the company is using the most up-to-date equipment and safety features, and that they are fully licensed and insured. Check that you\u2019re covered by your travel insurance for all the activities you want to undertake. British nationals have been injured and in some cases killed participating in extreme sports.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-safety\">Water safety</h2>\n\n<p>Shark attacks are relatively rare in Mexico, but you should take care particularly when surfing, research the local area and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Crocodiles are present in Mexico, most commonly in lagoons and coastal areas. Sightings have been reported near tourist areas, including Cancun and resorts on the Pacific coast. There are signs warning about crocodiles around many lagoons in these areas. Respect the warnings and don\u2019t walk too close to the water. Tourists have been seriously injured in crocodile attacks in the past.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hotel-safety\">Hotel safety</h2>\n<p>In some hotels, balcony balustrades may not be as high as you expect and there could be a risk of falling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>Mexico has an established multiparty democracy. Political demonstrations are common in Mexico City and can occur across the country. These can be tense and confrontational and could potentially turn violent. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in. You should monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>The Mexican constitution prohibits political activities by foreigners. Participation in demonstrations may result in detention and deportation.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in Mexico, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

If you\u2019re a resident you may be asked to provide your residency card issued by the Mexican government.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling between states or near international borders, you may be stopped by Mexican immigration authorities for immigration checks. You\u2019ll need to be able to provide your passport and FMM slip. Copies are not accepted. If you\u2019re unable to produce these documents, you may be detained, held at an immigration holding centre, and ultimately deported.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for drug offences are severe. Convictions carry sentences of up to 25 years.</p>\n\n<p>Although civil unions between same-sex partners are now legal in Mexico City and the state of Coahuila, homosexuality in Mexico is generally tolerated, rather than accepted. Public displays of affection between same sex couples may be frowned upon.

Assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy, might only be recognised in some Mexican states. If you\u2019re considering a surrogacy arrangement in Mexico, you should familiarise yourself with the relevant laws and regulations and make sure you\u2019ll meet all legal requirements to take the newborn child out of Mexico before you start the process. You should seek independent legal advice before entering into any surrogacy arrangement.

Check with your closest US Embassy/Consulate before attempting to cross the border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entry-to-mexico-from-guatemala\">Entry to Mexico from Guatemala</h3>\n\n<p>There have been reports of disruptions and tensions at the Mexico-Guatemala border. On 1 October a caravan of approximately 3000 migrants entered Guatemala and are currently making their way through Honduras to Mexico, bound for the United States (USA). Periodic border closures are possible and you should check with local authorities before attempting to cross the land border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"testing--screening-on-arrival\">Testing / screening on arrival</h3>\n\n<p>If you present symptoms of COVID-19 upon arrival at an airport in Mexico, you should ask for the International Health Team (\u201cSanidad Internacional\u201d).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"regular-entry-requirements\">Regular entry requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting Mexico as a tourist you don\u2019t need a visa, but you\u2019ll need to complete an immigration form and have this with you when you enter and leave Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>You can get an immigration form either when you arrive (forms are available at border crossings or on-board flights to Mexico) or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.inm.gob.mx/fmme/publico/en/solicitud.html\">online in advance</a> from the National Institute of Immigration website. Due to the requirements of the online system, the advance option is only possible if your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your intended date of entry to Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>You need an immigration form to leave the country. If you lose your immigration form you can get it replaced at the immigration office at any international airport in Mexico. The cost of a replacement is $500 Mexican Pesos, which is payable at a bank.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of bogus immigration officers operating within international airports. You should always refuse offers of help and head directly to the immigration office.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re crossing the border into Mexico from the US, there may not be an immigration officer at the port of entry. If not, you\u2019ll need to identify the nearest immigration office and clear your immigration status before you continue your journey into Mexico. The immigration office can usually be found close to the border area, and customs officials at the border should be able to tell you where to find it. If you fail to clear immigration at this point, it is often more complicated to do so once you have left the border area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"employment-voluntary-work-research-and-eco-activities\">Employment, voluntary work, research and eco activities</h3>\n<p>Tourists are not allowed to undertake voluntary (including human rights) work, or activity, or any form of paid employment. If you wish to carry out this type of work, you must get the correct visa from the Mexican Embassy before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You may need a visa to undertake certain adventure or eco-tourism activities like caving, potholing or entomology, especially if they involve any scientific or technological research. The Mexican authorities may define scientific or technological research activities far more broadly than other countries. If you\u2019re in any doubt, check with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/reinounido/index.php/en/\">Mexican Embassy in London</a> well in advance of your visit and ask for written confirmation if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>It is no longer possible to switch immigration status in-country. You can\u2019t enter Mexico on a tourist visa and then change it for a work visa. You must apply at the Mexican Consulate of your normal place of residence in plenty of time before you are due to travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"proof-of-accommodation-and-onward-travel\">Proof of accommodation and onward travel</h3>\n<p>Immigration officials at the port of entry may ask to see proof of your departure plans from Mexico before allowing you entry to the country. They can also ask to see proof of your booked accommodation, as well as funds to cover your intended stay while in Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>If you have been invited to stay in someone\u2019s home, immigration officials may also ask for a \u201cletter of invitation\u201d from the person you are visiting.
