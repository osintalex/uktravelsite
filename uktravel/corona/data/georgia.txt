However, the Georgian authorities have announced that a number of scheduled flights will re-start in November, including some to European destinations with connections to the UK. Check with your travel company for the latest information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entry-and-borders\">Entry and borders</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/georgia/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a> to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Georgia.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-in-georgia\">Travel in Georgia</h2>\n\n<p>Public transport is functioning normally in most of the country but inter-city services in the Adjara region have been suspended temporarily and the government has announced that further public transport restrictions may be introduced. Taxis can hold no more than three people in a single vehicle, including the driver, with passengers sitting in the rear. If travelling from or to Tbilisi airport by taxi this social distancing rule must still be observed. Face masks must be worn in all public transport and taxis.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n\n<p>Some hotels and other rental accommodation have re-opened but many remain closed.

No more than 10 people can participate in social gatherings such as weddings and funerals, indoor or out. There is no limit on gatherings for political or election-related activities. Most shops, and some restaurants and hotels are open but working from home is recommended where possible. Schools have restarted apart from in the Adjara region, although remote learning continues for older pupils. Universities reopened on 15 October but most teaching is on-line.</p>\n\n<p>It is mandatory to wear masks in enclosed spaces such as shops, when entering hotels and restaurants, and on public transport. Failing to do so can result in a 20 Lari (approx. \u00a35) fine for an individual or 500 Lari (approx. \u00a3130) for a legal entity. People are also now advised to wear masks outdoors in crowded areas.  In areas where there is an unexplained case of coronavirus, lockdown measures or testing may be introduced without warning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"healthcare-in-georgia\">Healthcare in Georgia</h2>\n\n<p>A number of medical facilities are allocated specifically for coronavirus patients, with further facilities in reserve. When cases had been low, everyone infected had been hospitalised as a precautionary measure. Since October only those with the most serious symptoms are taken to hospital.

These could escalate without warning.  You should check local media, stay away from any large gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. An increase in rallies is expected ahead of parliamentary elections taking place on 31 October.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Crime levels are low. However, you should exercise particular caution in areas frequented by tourists. There have been incidents of pick pocketing and burglary involving foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security, remain aware of your surroundings and keep your mobile phone charged and with you at all times.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of sexual assaults by taxi drivers after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Although Georgian legislation protects all people\u2019s human rights and equality, ethnic minorities and LGBT+ individuals may face discrimination. There have been reports of racially and sexuality motivated harassment and assaults. Georgian authorities are working to tackle discrimination and the Georgian parliament has passed anti-discrimination laws.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the victim of an attempted assault or feel threatened, contact the local police emergency number by dialling 112.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>The Administrative Boundary Lines with Abkhazia and South Ossetia are generally unmarked away from roads. Take care not to cross the lines inadvertently as you risk arrest. You may wish to hire a professional guide if you plan to hike close to the Administrative Boundary Lines.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal under Georgian law to enter Georgia from Russia via South Ossetia or Abkhazia. If you enter Georgia in this way you may face criminal prosecution, which carries the penalty of potentially heavy fines and/or a prison sentence of up to 4 years. If your passport has entry/exit stamps from the separatist authorities the Georgian authorities may consider this as illegal entry via an unrecognised border crossing.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering travelling to Russia via the land borders with the Russian Federation, consult <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/russia\"><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice for Russia</a>. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> currently advise against all travel to: Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan and the districts of Budyonnovsky, Levokumsky, Neftekumsky, Stepnovsky and Kursky in Stavropol Krai. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> also advise against all but essential travel to North Ossetia, Karachai-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria (including the Elbrus area).</p>\n\n<p>There is some risk from unexploded ordnance in areas along the Administrative Boundary Lines with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and near the border with Azerbaijan (Red Bridge area in particular). Areas where unexploded ordnance might be present are not always marked.</p>\n\n<p>If you visit the Udabno caves at the Davit Gareja monastery site, take care not to cross the Georgia-Azerbaijan border, which is unmarked in this area and disputed.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra precautions after dark in unfamiliar areas as you would at home.</p>\n\n<p>Taxi provision and safety has improved significantly but you should avoid flagging down unmarked taxis in the street, and check that the vehicle has working seatbelts. Unmarked taxis are not metered. Taxi apps, which offer a metered service, are available in the cities. Covid restrictions mean you must sit in the rear seat (maximum of two passengers) and wear a face mask.</p>\n\n<p>Street lighting away from main roads can be poor and pavements uneven.  There may be occasional short power cuts and you may wish to be prepared by carrying a torch.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mountaineering-and-extreme-sports\">Mountaineering and extreme sports</h3>\n\n<p>Take appropriate precautions when skiing and ensure you have valid insurance for skiing/winter sports in Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>If you get into trouble while hiking, skiing, or participating in adventure and/or extreme sports, the level of emergency response may be limited.</p>\n\n<p>It can be difficult to get accurate information on mountain conditions, including avalanche risks when off-piste skiing. If you are considering trekking, mountaineering, climbing off-piste skiing or other extreme sports you might consider contacting companies who can provide specialist guides.</p>\n\n<p>As Georgia\u2019s winter and adventure sports industry develops, the Georgian authorities are working hard to ensure proper safety standards are maintained.  However, be aware that, in some instances, safety standards may not be adequately observed.  For example, several people were injured when a ski lift at Gudauri malfunctioned in March 2018 and a tourist helicopter crashed near Stepantsminda (Kazbegi) in spring 2019.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Georgia with a valid UK driving licence for up to one year from your last entry into the country. Beyond this, you will need an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, make sure to check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel. They may require you to have an IDP.</p>\n\n<p>If an IDP is required, you should apply for a 1968 International Driving Permit. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Georgia after 28 March 2019. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving is on the right. The speed limit is 60 km/h in towns and cities. In other areas it\u2019s 80 km/h unless indicated.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a zero tolerance policy towards drink driving.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving especially at night. Many roads outside central Tbilisi, and other city centres, are badly lit and of poor quality. Stray livestock pose a hazard in many areas. Road markings and the right of way can be confusing. Many cars are poorly maintained and the standard of driving is erratic.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s compulsory to wear seat belts in the front seats in Georgia. Children under 12 years of age must sit in the back of the car. Children under 7 years of age must sit in child safety seats.</p>\n\n<p>Heavy rain, flooding and snow at higher altitudes can affect roads and bridges making travel difficult or impossible (particularly in remote areas). Landslides are also common. If you\u2019re travelling outside of Tbilisi, particularly in remote areas, make sure your vehicle is suitably equipped and check locally on current conditions.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/countries/georgia/\">RAC guide</a>\u00a0on driving in Georgia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Exercise normal caution with your personal safety and belongings when travelling by train.

UK citizens who wish to enter Georgia under this scheme will need to provide evidence of their permanent residence status at the airport.

If the antigen test is inconclusive, this will be followed by a PCR. If this test is negative, you will be able to leave quarantine but will have to take another PCR test on the 12th day. Those on an approved business permit have the option to take a PCR test every 72 hours instead of quarantine. Tests and quarantine will be at your own expense. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.</p>\n\n<p>For those with access to their own accommodation in Georgia it may be possible to self-isolate at home, rather than enter a quarantine hotel designated by the health authorities. If you wish to do this you will need to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://stopcov.ge/\">fill in the relevant form</a> in advance. A call centre will be in active communication with foreign nationals arriving in Georgia for the duration of their stay.</p>\n\n<p>The government has announced that the re-opening of Georgia\u2019s land and air borders is postponed until at least 1 November, and that the tourism sector won\u2019t be relaunched in 2020.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entry-permits-and-extensions\">Entry permits and extensions</h3>\n\n<p>The Georgian authorities recognise that some non-Georgian residents may be unable to renew their entry permits in due time due to border closures. The Government has announced that foreigners legally in Georgia up to 14 March but then unable to leave because of COVID-19 can remain until 31 December 2020 if their overstay was caused by one of the following circumstances, which must be documented:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>if the state of citizenship of the person was included in the high risk zone for the relevant period</li>\n  <li>if border restrictions were imposed by the relevant state</li>\n  <li>if the person was in hospital, quarantine or self-isolation due to health conditions</li>\n  <li>if the person was not able to leave the country due to flight cancellation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed the British Embassy that if you were legally in Georgia by 14 March and wish to renew your stay without applying for a residence card, you will need to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.my.gov.ge\">book an appointment at a Public Service House</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should attend your appointment with a Georgian-speaker if needed as you will need to make your renewal application and be interviewed in Georgian.  Your application must include the reason why you could not renew your visa in time or renew it on-line during the State of Emergency.  The fee is 50 lari (approx. \u00a313).  The Public Service House will review the case and make a decision within three days on whether, and if so, for how long to renew your visa.</p>\n\n<p>If you meet the requirements to apply for a Georgian Residence Permit such as working or studying, you can book an appointment at a Public Service House to start the procedure.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in Georgia for more than 183 days and take up any form of paid employment, you are automatically liable for income tax and must inform the Revenue Service of your employment, whether you have registered as officially resident or not. Non-compliance will be fined.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"uk-passports\">UK passports</h3>\n\n<p>In consideration of the difficulty of renewing UK passports during coronavirus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that the Georgian authorities will recognise the validity of the following UK passports for residence and visa purposes until the UK Government informs otherwise:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a UK passport that has expired since 6 January 2020 or has less than six months\u2019 validity when presented to Georgian authorities will now be recognised as expiring on 31 December 2021  The UK Government has confirmed that it will continue to recognise any British national holding such passports as British under international law</li>\n  <li>these amendments apply to those holding the following passports - British Citizen, British National (Overseas), British Protected Person, British Overseas Citizen and British Subject</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The recognition of UK passport extensions only applies where you need a valid passport to reside in Georgia or when applying for an appropriate visa or residence permit.</p>\n\n<p>If your passport has expired and you need to leave Georgia, you will need to apply for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD) through the British Embassy in Tbilisi.

You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-medicines\">Travelling with medicines</h3>\n\n<p>Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy, which can also cover prescription and non-prescription drugs or medicines, otherwise commonly available in the UK and the European Union. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal in Georgia. This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to administrative and criminal proceedings. Before travelling, check Georgia\u2019s medication importation regulations on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rs.ge/en/5982\">Ministry of Health website</a></p>\n\n<p>If you intend to travel with prescription medicine, you must carry a doctor\u2019s prescription and ideally the original packaging.

Very few public or private facilities are accessible. Most public transport offers no accommodation for persons with disabilities. There are few pavements outside of main cities and where pavements are present they are generally uneven.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting Georgia for the purpose of commissioning surrogacy arrangements, you should consider the potential risks and challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy and seek specialist legal advice on Georgian and UK laws prior to making any arrangements. Surrogacy is a complex and lengthy process. The British Embassy doesn\u2019t have authority to be involved in surrogacy arrangements. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> and Home Office have produced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">guidance</a> to help inform you on the issues you may face when embarking on a surrogacy arrangement. Commissioning a surrogacy won\u2019t automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you\u2019re fully aware of the facts and are well prepared before starting the process. Research prospective surrogacy clinics and hospitals thoroughly to ensure you\u2019re dealing with a safe and reputable organisation. From 1 September 2020 Georgian law requires you to provide evidence of marriage, civil partnership or cohabitation of at least a year, before a surrogacy contact can be entered into. The British Embassy can\u2019t recommend specific hospitals or clinics.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to bring children born via surrogacy from Georgia to the UK you must apply for a full validity British passport, for which a Georgian birth certificate will be needed. You should check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://psh.gov.ge/main/menus/1\">Public Service Hall website</a> and research the requirements which must be met to have a Georgian birth certificate issued and to leave the country with your child. For example, the Georgian authorities recently changed their process for obtaining a birth certificate, strictly enforcing the requirements for a surrogacy contract to be signed before birth. The maximum period of visa-free stay allowed by the Georgian authorities is one year. Extensions of stay are unlikely to be granted.</p>\n\n<p>For further detailed information about visa issues in Georgia, see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.geoconsul.gov.ge/\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"south-ossetia-and-abkhazia\">South Ossetia and Abkhazia</h3>\n\n<p>The government of Georgia does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence by the breakaway regions of South Ossetia or Abkhazia and, in accordance with international law, continues to claim the right to exercise sovereignty in the two territories. The UK government, along with almost all other states, recognises Georgia\u2019s right to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The government of Georgia has implemented legislation which requires those trading with Abkhazia and South Ossetia to hold a licence issued by the Georgian government. This includes buying and selling property and most financial transactions. Those who trade without licences may be open to penalties under Georgian civil and criminal law.</p>\n\n<p>The ownership of many properties is disputed across both regions with many thousands of claims to ownership of properties from people displaced following the conflicts after the collapse of the USSR. Purchase of these properties could have serious financial and legal implications, including legal proceedings in the courts of Georgia, as well as attempts to enforce judgements from these courts elsewhere in Europe. A future settlement to these territorial disputes could have consequences for property purchased in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, including possible restitution of the property to its original owners.</p>\n\n", "slug": "local-laws-and-customs", "title": "Local laws and customs"}, {"body": "\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p><strong>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Georgia on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/87/georgia\">TravelHealthPro website</a></p>\n\n<p>See the healthcare information in the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/georgia/coronavirus\">Coronavirus section</a> for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Georgia.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> on the TravelHealthPro website.
