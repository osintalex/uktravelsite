The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Mali, including Bamako.</p>\n\n<p>Following the military coup on 18 August 2020, the situation in Bamako is calm. You should remain vigilant and monitor local media for any developments.</p>\n\n<p>There are an increasing number of inter and intra-communal security incidents in many parts of the country, notably in Mopti and Segou regions. In March 2019, 160 villagers were killed by masked gunmen in a single attack in Ogossagou in central Mali. In February 2020, 35 villagers were killed in the same location. Landmines are used by groups operating in Centre, North and North East Mali.</p>\n\n<p>There have been recent changes in the security situation in parts of Segou province/region. It remains fluid. On 26 January 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military camp in Sokolo, killing 20 soldiers. On 17 February 2020, armed elements attacked a checkpoint of Bla, approximately 70 km south-east of S\u00e9gou town. On the 6 June 2020, terrorists conducted an attack in the area of Sarakala in Markala commune resulting in Malian Army vehicles and weapons being stolen.  On 14 June 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military convey approximately 160km north of Segou town, killing 24 soldiers.  If you\u2019re in or travelling to rural areas outside the town of Segou, you should regularly review risks, and your resultant security arrangements, consider additional security measures and keep up to date with developments.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in Mali can be difficult and conditions are poor for overland travel. You should take all necessary safety precautions, especially outside of main urban areas, have confidence in your security arrangements and maintain a high level of vigilance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Starting on 10 July 2020, large-scale political protests have taken place in Bamako and some other regional towns. These have turned violent resulting in burning of tires, clashes with the police, blockage on the roads and bridges, the deployment of tear gas, and small arms fire. There have been reports of several deaths and injuries. Protests and civil disobedience have increased in frequency. The British Embassy expects these protests to continue in the near future across Bamako and in other major cities in Mali, and will be difficult to predict in location and severity. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local news.</p>\n\n<p>On 19 August 2020, President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta (IBK) announced his resignation following a military coup.</p>\n\n<p>Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and may see a heavy police and security presence.  Protests have taken place recently in Bamako and other cities across Mali. If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should leave the area immediately, remain vigilant, and follow the local news as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning. You should stay away from any blockades set up by the police and security forces.</p>\n\n<p>There was a coup in Mali in 2012 following armed conflict in the north. Following a French-led military intervention, democracy was restored in 2013. A peace agreement has been signed by most parties to the earlier conflict and a process of reconciliation is continuing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Night-time checkpoints operate in Bamako at various locations. Checkpoints are in place from approximately 9pm until dawn.</p>\n\n<p>Keep vehicle and personal identification documents with you at all times while travelling by road. Approach security checkpoints slowly and comply with instructions given. There have been incidents late at night where people dressed as policemen have demanded money from drivers in Bamako. Ask to see identification. Don\u2019t resist if the person is armed.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions off the main roads are often poor, especially in the rainy season (June to October). Other road users may drive dangerously. You should take particular care and attention when driving in urban centres.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of a vehicle accident, go to the nearest police station to file a report immediately. If you remain on the spot you may be vulnerable. Medical help in the event of an accident is likely to be limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>Following the military coup on 18 August 2020, regional borders are closed.

The Festival au D\u00e9sert in Timbuktu was cancelled in January 2017 and has not taken place since due to security concerns. Festivals in other parts of the country are also vulnerable to attack. There may be a heightened risk of attack during election periods.</p>\n\n<p>During public holidays and festivals, including New Year celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should consider whether you need to visit it.</p>\n\n<p>Notable attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 14 June 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military convey approximately 160km north of Segou town, killing 24 soldiers.</li>\n  <li>On 6 June 2020, terrorists conducted an attack in the area of Sarakala, Segou region, resulting in Malian Army vehicles and weapons being stolen.</li>\n  <li>On 6 April 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military base in Bamba, Gao region, killing 25 soldiers.</li>\n  <li>On 26 January 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military camp in Sokolo, Segou region, killing 20 soldiers</li>\n  <li>On 24 February 2019, insurgents attacked the Koulikoro Training Centre, the main training base in Mali for the European Union Training Mission, approximately 55km northeast of Bamako.

There have been a number of recent bomb attacks in Gao, Kidal, Timbuktu and in Khalil. Methods of attack have included complex attacks by militants, vehicle ambushes, small arms fire and the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Malian, MINUSMA (the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali) and international security forces are regularly targeted, particularly in the regions of Kidal, Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao and Menaka, and attacks are increasingly frequent.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2017 the government of Mali joined Chad, Burkina Faso, Niger and Mauritania (G5 Sahel countries) in announcing an agreement to set up a joint counter-terrorism force to tackle the jihadist threat, named the G5 Sahel Joint Force. The Joint Force has also been targeted by extremists.</p>\n\n<p>The threat is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. The threat to western interests in the region remains. \nRead more about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">threat from terrorism in the Sahel region</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a very high threat of kidnapping by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and other regional Islamist groups These groups operate in the border areas of northern Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Libya, and have an increasing presence in the centre. Although the kidnap threat is most significant in Northern Mali, there\u2019s a risk of kidnap in all areas of Mali including the capital Bamako and areas in the south of Mali where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel. Westerners have been kidnapped in Mali, including in Kidal, Kayes, Timbuktu, Gao and Hombori, and the wider Sahel region.</p>\n\n<p>Recent kidnaps include:\n* An Italian and Canadian national were kidnapped in December 2018 in Burkina Faso and were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in northeast Mali after reportedly escaping. \n* In May 2019, 2 French tourists and their Beninese guide were kidnapped in northern Benin by an armed group. The guide was found dead and the hostages were later rescued in northern Burkina Faso whilst reportedly on their way to Mali.\n* In January 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in northern Burkina Faso and subsequently found dead. \n* Several foreign nationals were kidnapped in from the northeastern region of neighbouring Burkina Faso in September 2018. In February 2017 a Colombian nun was kidnapped in Sikasso region, in the south of Mali.</p>\n\n<p>An Italian and Canadian national were kidnapped in December 2018 in Burkina Faso and were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in northeast Mali after reportedly escaping.

You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping areas, hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-terrorist-threat-in-the-sahel-and-lake-chad-basin\">The terrorist threat in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin</h3>\n\n<p>There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include JNIM, Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for JNIM. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>French is the official language in Mali.

There is a heightened risk of attack in Bamako. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant, especially in places such as hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, shopping areas, markets, transport hubs, places of worship and businesses with western interests. Keep a low profile and follow the advice of local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There have been recent changes in the security situation in parts of Segou province/region.  See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/Safety-and-security#local-travel\">Local travel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>During public holidays and festivals, including New Year celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should consider whether you need to visit it.</p>\n\n<p>A nationwide state of emergency in place since November 2015 has been extended several times, most recently in October 2019 by one year until 31 October 2020. You should expect a robust security presence including police patrols and possible police security checks on restaurants and hotels. There are likely to be more vehicle and personal security checks during this time and nobody will be exempt.</p>\n\n<p>Mali held legislative elections in March and April 2020. Since 1 May, regular, large and at times violent protests have taken place in Bamako, resulting in burning of tires, clashes with the police, blockage on the roads and bridges, the deployment of tear gas, and small arms fire. There have been reports of several deaths and injuries. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local social media/news.</p>\n\n<p>On 19 August 2020, President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta (IBK) announced his resignation following a military coup. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mali/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Recent public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. You should stay away from all political demonstrations and any blockades set up by the police and security forces. Maintain several days\u2019 stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako).</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in parts of Mali, especially outside Bamako.
