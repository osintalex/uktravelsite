While the vast majority of demonstrations are peaceful, there is a risk of isolated incidents of unrest or violence. If you\u2019re in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, remain vigilant and move away quickly if there are signs of disorder.</p>\n\n<p>Some demonstrations can affect access to the <a href=\"/government/world/belgium\">British Embassy and the British Consulate General</a> and cause travel disruption in central Brussels. For regular updates on any disruption, you can check local news, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.belgiantrain.be/en\">Belgian Railways website</a> (train and metro travel) and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://wego.here.com/traffic/belgium/brussels?map=50.84439,4.35609,11,traffic&amp;x=ep\">HERE map website</a> (road travel).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Petty crime rates are similar to the UK, but on the increase. You should take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>\n\n<p>Take only the minimum amount of cash, credit cards and personal ID necessary when you go out. As far as possible leave jewellery, other valuables and documents in a secure place like a hotel safe. Avoid carrying money, bank/credit cards and your passport in the same bag or pocket. Leave a photocopy of your passport and itinerary with a contact in the UK. Enter next-of-kin details into the back of your passport.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of theft, contact the nearest police station and get a police report. If you lose your passport, you should also contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukinbelgium.fcdo.gov.uk\">British Embassy in Brussels</a>. If you have difficulty reporting the theft of your cards to your UK card issuer, you can ask the Belgian group \u2018Card Stop\u2019 (telephone: +32 (0) 70 344 344) to send a fax to your UK card company to block your card. Alternatively, if you have Belgian issued bank/credit cards, Card Stop will be able to block them.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant and take extra care in major railway stations, and on public transport, particularly late at night. Thieves and muggers operate around the Brussels Gare du Midi/Zuidstation (Eurostar terminal), Gare du Nord and Schuman (the EU quarter). Pickpockets also operate on international trains, mainly Paris-Brussels and Amsterdam-Brussels.</p>\n\n<p>Never leave luggage unattended. There have been reports of luggage being stolen from the racks at the end of carriages in high-speed trains (TGV and Thalys), usually just before the doors close.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel by taxi, use official, licensed taxis or a pre-booked minicab. We recommend that you avoid hailing taxis on the street, and do not use taxis that stop but were not specifically hailed.</p>\n\n<p>Do not leave valuable items visible in your car, even when you are in it. Keep car doors locked and windows secure at all times. It is increasingly common for thieves, usually on motorbikes, to break a window and snatch valuables from the front or back passenger seat when the vehicle is stationary at traffic lights. Car jacking, especially of up-market vehicles, remains a risk.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>When visiting former WW1 battlefields in north west Belgium, stay on the footpath and exercise caution if you see anything that looks like shells or munitions. Unexploded shells have recently been uncovered. Move away from the site and call the police emergency number 112 to report any incidents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Traffic is fast and Belgium\u2019s accident rate is high mainly due to speeding. In 2019 there were 646 road deaths in Belgium (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">source: Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 5.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n<p>To drive in Belgium you must have a valid UK driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents.

Exemptions to this rule include motorways, roundabouts, roads sign-posted with an orange diamond within a white background, and drivers who are attempting to join a road after having driven down a street in the wrong direction.</p>\n\n<p>Trams have priority over other traffic. If a tram or bus stops in the middle of the road to allow passengers on or off, you must stop.</p>\n\n<p>There is a speed restriction of 30 km/h in school areas, which is operational 24 hours (even when schools are closed), unless indicated otherwise. The start and finish of these zones are not always clearly marked.</p>\n\n<p>Fines have increased dramatically (up to \u20ac 2,750 for exceeding the speed limit by 40 km/h and a possible court appearance for exceeding the speed limit by more than 40km/h). If you are unable to pay an on the spot fine your vehicles may be impounded.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t drink and drive; frequent alcohol checks are made. Less than 0.05% alcohol in the bloodstream is allowed (a lower level than in the UK). A blood sample will be taken if you refuse to be breathalysed. Fines are heavy depending on the degree of intoxication and range from \u20ac1,100 to \u20ac11,000.
