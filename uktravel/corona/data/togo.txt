Protests by both the opposition and the government have continued sporadically since then, both in Lom\u00e9 and across the country,  with at least 12 deaths and over 80 people arrested.  There have been sporadic outbreaks of violence, particularly in the north around the towns of Mango and Sokod\u00e9.</p>\n\n<p>Political dialogue between the government and opposition is ongoing, but a resolution has not yet been reached and further marches and protests, by supporters of the government and opposition may occur. You should exercise caution, avoid crowds and demonstrations and monitor local media.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent crime, theft and pick-pocketing are common throughout Togo and you should be especially cautious in Lom\u00e9 along the beach and in the markets. Attacks occur during daylight as well as at night. You should avoid travelling alone where possible, even within Lom\u00e9 city limits, especially at night. You should be alert to the risk of car-jackings, including through staged accidents. It\u2019s generally better not to resist armed attack.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Exit and entry points at borders can be opened and closed at short notice. Be prepared for checks by the local police and military.</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in the region. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in Togo\u2019s northern border region.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware of the risk of kidnapping and should ensure you have carefully considered the threat.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Togo on a UK driving licence for a short stay. If you\u2019re staying longer than 6 months, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> is also required.  This must be renewed annually.  Conversion to a local Togolese licence is not required, although it is possible. You would be required to take a driving test in Togo.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards and road conditions in Togo can be poor. Avoid travelling outside towns and cities at night as roads are poorly lit. During the rainy season minor, unpaved roads may become impassable. You should stop at all control points on request, turn on interior vehicle lights and only continue when permission has been given to do so. You may encounter official and unofficial roadblocks.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against large vessels in Togolese waters and those of neighbouring countries. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h3>\n\n<p>You should take care if you decide to swim in the  sea as ocean currents are very strong along the coast. There have been a number of drownings each year.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>The number of British visitors to Togo is low. The main type of incident for which British nationals need consular assistance in Togo is replacing lost and stolen passports. You should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times and keep  your passport in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is limited in Togo as there is no British Embassy.  The Honorary Consul in Togo can offer limited consular assistance. British nationals should contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-accra\">British High Commission in Accra, Ghana</a> who can provide consular support.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorist attacks in Togo can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.
