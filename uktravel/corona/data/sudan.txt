There have been ad hoc peaceful protests across the city linked to the fuel shortage and wheat prices and also around issues of transitional justice.  Sporadic unofficial roadblocks linked to protests can appear in parts of the city with little or no warning. If you encounter a roadblock, remain calm and seek an alternative route.

Banditry and lawlessness are widespread, and there are frequent violent confrontations between rebel and government forces, between tribes and over economic resources (land, gold), as well as continuing anti-government protests.

A number of aid workers and peacekeepers have been killed in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnapping. Kidnappings can be for financial or political gain, and can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. There have been a number of kidnappings, including of British nationals and other westerners.

Recent fighting in Kassala is between groups supporting and opposing the appointment of the new civilian State Governor. There have also been clashes between tribal groups in Red Sea State hat have resulted in a number of fatalities. In July there were violent clashes in Port Sudan and a local curfew was been imposed. If you\u2019re in Port Sudan, follow the instructions of local authorities, observe any curfews and avoid large crowds.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling by road in Kassala State, you should keep to the major roads, as people-trafficking groups are believed to operate in some areas.</p>\n\n<p>Local tensions in the Galabat area have previously resulted in the closure of the Metema-Galabat border post at short notice.

There is a high risk of being involved in a traffic accident when using public transport or vehicles for hire such as rickshaws and \u2018amjad minivans\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are poor and many roads, even major ones, are not tarred or have potholes. Many roads are unsurfaced. Roads are used by pedestrians, donkey-carts and rickshaws, as well as motor vehicles. At night, there is generally no street lighting and many vehicles have no lights.</p>\n\n<p>If your journey doesn\u2019t follow a major route you should travel with an experienced local guide. Many areas south of Khartoum become inaccessible by road during the rainy season from July to October. The wadis (dry riverbeds) are subject to dangerous flash floods and many are not passable during the rains except on a major road.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Sudan using a full UK driving licence for a maximum period of 3 months. You can get a local driving licence from the police traffic department. Although drivers should have a licence and insurance, many do not have these.
