Muggings, pick pocketing, snatch-and-grab robberies, theft of unattended bags and purse snatching are believed to be more common, especially in crowded places (bazaars, public transportation). Home burglaries and break-ins occur, even in wealthier neighbourhoods.</p>\n\n<p>You should exercise caution and take measures to protect your personal security  as you would when visiting any European country.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of raids on local establishments, including restaurants. Foreigners haven\u2019t  been deliberately targeted, but the use of violence against restaurant guests and staff has been reported. If you\u2019re caught up in such a situation like this, keep calm, follow any instructions given and leave the area as soon as it is permitted and safe to do so.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h3>\n\n<p>Dual nationality is not recognised in Uzbekistan. If you enter Uzbekistan on an Uzbek passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance.

But it remains valid in the longer term, once normal travel in and to Uzbekistan can resume.</p>\n\n<p>On 1 May 2020, a partial collapse of the Sardoba Reservoir dam caused significant flooding in the Syrdarya region. You should exercise caution if within the area and follow the advice of local authorities and emergency services.</p>\n\n<p>On 6 November 2019, it was reported that 17 people were killed in an armed attack on a Tajik security check-point on the Uzbek/Tajik border. Daesh/ISIS claimed responsibility. You should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Uzbek/Tajik border.</p>\n\n<p>Tensions exist over recognition of the Uzbek/Kyrgyz border. There have been a number of security incidents in this region including several gunfire exchanges. As above, security incidents have also been reported along the Uzbek/Tajik border.</p>\n\n<p>Land borders between Uzbekistan and neighbouring states, particularly Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, are often closed at short notice. Check in advance which border posts are open.</p>\n\n<p>Care should be taken when travelling in the areas bordering Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan, as some border areas may be land-mined.

You must carry your UK Driving Licence or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>\u00a0at all times.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Uzbekistan with a valid UK driving licence for the whole length of your visit. It is recommended to make a copy of your driving licence translated either into Russian or Uzbek to make interaction with local authorities and traffic police easier, although it is not legally required. If you\u2019re living in Uzbekistan, it is recommended to  get a local driving licence or its equivalent.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to use an International Driving Permit, from 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Uzbekistan.  From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Take care as many roads are poorly-surfaced and badly-lit.</p>\n\n<p>Driving is on the right in Uzbekistan. Vehicles approaching a roundabout have the right of way over vehicles already on the roundabout.</p>\n\n<p>Seatbelts for drivers and passengers are compulsory and the use of mobile phones while driving is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>There are security checkpoints at the city limits of Tashkent and other towns.</p>\n\n<p>A new regulation has been introduced allowing only licensed taxis (with certain colour and signs and card payment equipment) to operate in Uzbekistan. However, unlicensed taxis continue to operate. You should use official taxis where possible.</p>\n\n<p>Many buses and taxis in Uzbekistan run on Compressed Natural Gas and safety regulations are often not followed. Where possible you should opt for modern vehicles when travelling by bus or taxi.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re advised to use only official taxis. Many do not have rear seat belts, so you may wish to ask for a taxi with seat belts in the front and rear.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling long distances by train.

Any traveller found to have overstayed will face a fine and possibly deportation. It is not always easy or possible to extend your stay or a visa if you wish to remain in the country for longer than you had originally intended.

Hotel staff will complete the registration paperwork and return your passport to you.</p>\n\n<p>If staying in a private house, your host should register you with their local district OVIR (Department of Foreign Travel &amp; Exit (they also deal with the registration of Foreign Citizens)) or on the electronic registration system Emehmon. If you travel to another city and plan to stay for longer than three days, you will need to register again. You must follow this procedure, as a full record of your whereabouts whilst in Uzbekistan is required upon departure. Visitors who are unable to account for their whereabouts could be fined and possibly deported.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists transiting Uzbekistan in recreational vehicles or staying in tents/camping are responsible for their own registration. They should register online via the electronic registration system <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.emehmon.uz/\">Emehmon</a> within three days of arrival.  During the online registration process there will be a tourist tax charge for each day of their stay. At the moment tourist tax can only be paid online by Uzbek debit card in local currency, payable by credit or debit card, therefore tourists should seek assistance from hotels or local tour operators.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n\n<p>Your passport should be valid for at least 3 months beyond your date of entry to Uzbekistan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h3>\n<p>Dual nationality is not recognised in Uzbekistan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"uk-emergency-travel-documents\">UK Emergency Travel Documents</h3>\n<p>UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry (with a valid Uzbek visa), direct airside transit and exit from Uzbekistan.

This process can take at least 5 working days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs-declarations\">Customs declarations</h3>\n<p>You should fill out two copies of the customs declaration form on arrival. Make sure that both copies are signed and stamped by Customs officials. You will need to present one to the customs authorities as you enter the country and produce the other on departure. Any currency or valuables found in your possession and not declared on your customs declaration form may be confiscated.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-medicines\">Travelling with medicines</h3>\n<p>If you enter Uzbekistan with medicines, whether prescription or non-prescription, you should check in advance the list of prohibited medicines and the legal quantities of medicines that are allowed to be imported. You can find information on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://customs.uz/en/lists/view/117\">State Customs Committee of Uzbekistan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should carry a doctor\u2019s prescription if you intend to travel with prescription medicines and declare the items on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Uzbekistan, including codeine. Possession of these items can lead to administrative or criminal proceedings if you don\u2019t have a prescription, or if you\u2019re carrying more than you need for the visit and don\u2019t declare them on arrival. Issues have most frequently been reported at land borders.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones</h3>\n\n<p>Unauthorised import and use of drones in Uzbekistan will attract fines, detention and confiscation of equipment.
