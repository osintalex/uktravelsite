Political events may impact on the security situation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"humanitarian-crisis\">Humanitarian crisis</h3>\n<p>The ongoing political impasse and conflict has seriously affected public infrastructure and services, resulting in power cuts, water, fuel, food and cash shortages, absence of medicines, and high inflation.</p>\n\n<p>The UN High Commission for Refugees assess that more than 1.3 million people \u2013 including internally displaced people (IDPs), as well as vulnerable Libyans, host communities, migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers \u2013 are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.</p>\n\n<p>Power outages can last for 18 hours per day in Tripoli and several days in the South and are affecting mobile phone and internet signals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a very high risk of criminal kidnap for ransom in Tripoli and coastal towns to the West of Tripoli. There\u2019s an elevated risk of kidnap for ransom and arbitrary detention by local militias throughout Libya.</p>\n\n<p>Ongoing conflict and the proliferation of armed militias has led to a rise in crime in most areas, including violent robbery, carjacking and kidnapping.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, a number of foreign nationals have been shot dead in Libya. Foreigners are also increasingly targeted for kidnappings by both criminal and extremist groups. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>If you travel to Libya against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should regularly reassess your security arrangements and carefully plan your movements. Take security advice from competent security experts before any travel within the country. Close security protection is extremely important.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of a further deterioration of the security situation, routes in and out of major cities and towns may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t advertise your travel or other plans through social media. Avoid routine, vary your travel routes, and keep a low profile at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-for-mediajournalism-purposes\">Travel for media/journalism purposes</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Libya as a media representative, you should get press accreditation from the relevant Libyan authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Journalists, including foreign nationals, are vulnerable to mistreatment by armed groups in Libya. Intimidation, attacks, detentions and kidnapping of local journalists are a serious problem, and a number have been killed. There is a real risk of hostility from those who object to media reporting. Regular, semi-regular and irregular detention of foreign nationals occurs regularly in all parts of Libya.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Road travel within Libya remains highly dangerous. There continues to be a risk of being caught up in outbreaks of hostilities. There\u2019s also a high risk of carjacking and robbery. The coastal road between Zawiyah and Tripoli presents an elevated risk. There\u2019s a risk of striking unexploded ordnance off-road.</p>\n\n<p>Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>All land borders into Libya are subject to closure at short notice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>Flights to and from all airports in Libya are likely to be cancelled at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Inter-militia fighting poses significant risks to air travel in Libya. It has periodically caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports. All airports are vulnerable to attack.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Mitiga airport, Tripoli\u2019s only functioning civilian airport, has been regularly shelled by artillery. An attack on 9 May 2020 involving 70 rounds caused considerable damage.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> staff do not regularly travel by air to or from Mitiga.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Tripoli International Airport has been closed since July 2014, following clashes that broke out between armed groups in the area surrounding the airport. Other airports may change their flight schedule without notice.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>Benghazi airport is currently closed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Due to a number of ongoing safety concerns, the European Union has agreed with the Libyan authorities to continue a voluntary restriction on Libyan airlines flying into the EU. However, some Libyan airlines operate flights to the EU using aircraft leased from other airlines. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices.

Find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">global threat from terrorism</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Extremist groups including Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) are responsible for the majority of attacks, which have targeted foreign and diplomatic personnel and premises, international hotels, commercial and oil installations, and government and other official security institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Although GNA- aligned forces, supported by U.S. airstrikes, declared the end of operations against Daesh in Sirte in January 2016, Daesh remain a serious threat to security in Libya.</p>\n\n<p>Daesh claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack on the High National Election Commission in Tripoli on 2 May 2018, in which at least 13 people were killed and many injured, and further attacks on the National Oil Corporation in central Tripoli on 10 September 2018, in which at least 2 people were killed, and on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tripoli on 25 December 2018, which killed at least two people. In August 2019, a car bomb explosion in the eastern city of Benghazi killed five, including three foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>On 24 November 2018, Daesh claimed responsibility for an attack on the central Libyan town of Tazerbo, in which at least 9 people were killed, 5 injured and 20 others kidnapped.</p>\n\n<p>On 4 October 2017, at least 4 people were killed and many were wounded in a Daesh suicide bomb attack at the main court building in the city of Misrata. On 23 August 2017, at least 11 were killed in a Daesh attack on a checkpoint in the central Jufra region.  On 2 October 2016, a Dutch journalist was killed in Sirte, while reporting on the fighting between pro-GNA forces and Daesh. In Dernah, there\u2019s an ongoing conflict between the Libyan National Army and local armed groups.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups in southern and south-west Libya are also of concern and are using the area as a safe haven and transit route. Attacks have been launched in Libya and across the wider region, for example the In Amenas attack in Algeria in January 2013. Armed groups remain largely autonomous due the unstable political and security situation across large areas of Libya.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in border regions is especially risky. Regional extremist groups, including Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, operate in the border areas of northern Mali, Niger and Algeria. They have a proven capability of travelling long distances to carry out attacks, including in neighbouring countries and Libya.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There remains a continuing high threat of kidnap from criminal groups, armed groups and terrorist groups across the whole of Libya. Security precautions do not mitigate the threat.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups including Daesh, Al Qaeda and their affiliates routinely use kidnapping as a tactic and are capable of conducting kidnapping across borders. Terrorist groups within Libya have both intent and capability to carry out further kidnappings. It\u2019s a realistic possibility that they will target foreign nationals. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnappings, and there\u2019s a realistic possibility that they would sell hostages on to terrorist groups. Foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Libya in the last 12 months. Four foreign nationals were kidnapped in south-west Libya in November 2017 and most recently, 4 foreign nationals were kidnapped in south-east Libya in July 2018. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">Sahel</a> \npage for information on the regional threat.</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya, Mauritania and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>If you do choose to travel to Libya against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should pay careful attention to your safety and security. Security precautions don\u2019t remove the threat and <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice remains against all travel to the country.</p>\n\n", "slug": "terrorism", "title": "Terrorism"}, {"body": "<p>There\u2019s a very real threat of kidnap to westerners in the Sahel and surrounding region. The Sahel region includes Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. The kidnap threat extends to other countries including Algeria, Cameroon, Libya and Nigeria. There is a continuing threat of kidnap following the military intervention in Mali which began in January 2013. Further attacks are highly likely.</p>\n\n<p>There are several hostages still being held in the Sahel and surrounding region, some of whom have been held for 3 years. Victims in the region have included construction workers, NGO workers, tourists and diplomats of various nationalities, primarily European. Some hostages have been killed, including 9 British nationals since 2009.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking and finances terrorist activity. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"who-are-the-terrorists\">Who are the terrorists?</h3>\n\n<p>The terrorist threat in the Sahel and surrounding region comes from a number of groups, including Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and Al Murabitun, a merger of the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJWA) and Mokhtar Belmokhtar\u2019s group. These terrorist groups aspire to establish Islamic law in the region and to attack Western interests. Some extremists in Libya are now aligning themselves with Daesh. In February 2015, one such group murdered Egyptian Coptic Christians who had been abducted in kidnappings in Sirte in December 2014 and January 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The groups carry out kidnappings of Westerners for financial gain, prisoner exchange and to exert political pressure on governments. Kidnapping for ransom is AQ-M\u2019s primary source of finance.</p>\n\n<p>AQ-M and regional Islamist groups operate in the border areas of northern Mali, Niger and Algeria. They have proven capability of travelling long distances to carry out attacks, including in Algeria, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnappings for terrorist groups in return for financial payment.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2013 terrorist groups in the region have also kidnapped westerners in Cameroon and Nigeria. The main terrorist threat in the region comes from Boko Haram and Ansaru.</p>\n\n<p>Boko Haram is an Islamist extremist group in Nigeria that has been proscribed by the UK as a terrorist organisation.</p>\n\n<p>Boko Haram regularly mounts attacks in northern Nigeria. Most attacks occur in the north east, particularly in Borno and Yobe states where Boko Haram has its operating base. There have, however, been a large number of attacks in other Nigerian states and further attacks could occur anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Ansaru is an Islamist terrorist organisation based in northern Nigeria, and is proscribed by the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Ansaru have carried out a number of kidnap attacks in Nigeria. Boko Haram have taken hostages from neighbouring Cameroon and are consistently kidnapping local nationals and Cameroonians.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rally-racing\">Rally racing</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re taking part in a cross-country rally that travels through the Sahel and surrounding region, you should be aware of the high risk of kidnapping in parts of the region.</p>\n\n<p>Some rallies in the 2012-13 season were cancelled or rerouted because of the risk. One of the most famous rallies in the region, the Paris-Dakar Rally, now takes place in South America due to the threat of kidnap.

It has periodically caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports. All airports are vulnerable to attack. Mitiga Airport, Tripoli\u2019s only functioning civilian airport, has been regularly shelled by artillery, most recently on 9 May 2020. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> staff do not regularly travel by air to or from Mitiga. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/libya/safety-and-security#air-travel\">Air travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Since April 2019, there has been a significant build-up of militarised forces across western and central Libya.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/libya/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. In August 2019, a car bomb explosion in the eastern city of Benghazi killed five, including three foreign nationals. There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners, including from Daesh-affiliated extremists (formerly referred to as ISIL) and Al Qaida, as well as armed militias. Daesh and Al Qaeda have attacked a number of oil and gas installations and killed or kidnapped workers, including foreign nationals. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/libya/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>In August and September 2020 both Tripoli and Benghazi saw demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions and corruption. Pockets of violence were seen, with reports of civilians being shot and wounded.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Libya against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should get the right visa, or risk deportation.
