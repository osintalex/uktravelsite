Traffic disruptions can arise unexpectedly and at any time due to these demonstrations. There have been reports of violent incidents when drivers have tried to ignore blockades. Check local information and plan your journey carefully to ensure you stay well away from these incidents where possible. Allow extra time for your travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>In August 2018, 2 female tourists from Mexico and Spain were raped and killed in separate crime-related incidents. In March 2018, a tourist group was assaulted at gunpoint on the shores of River Pacuare. In January 2018, a tourist bus was stopped by criminals and passengers were robbed at gunpoint near Tortuguero, Limon Province.</p>\n\n<p>You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK, including when using ATMs. Petty theft of personal items including passports is a significant problem.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant when using buses, as thefts are common. Bags in overhead compartments are particularly vulnerable. Thieves have simple but effective ways of distracting you. Be particularly watchful of your valuables at the beach.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid leaving drinks unattended in bars as there have been reports of \u2018spiked\u2019 drinks resulting in assault and theft.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using unofficial taxis - \u2018taxi piratas\u2019. Violent incidents involving tourists have been reported. Official taxis are red (or orange at the airport) with a triangular sticker and plastic box on the roof with the name and number of the taxi company. Ideally, use radio-dispatched taxis. Make sure the driver\u2019s ID is clearly visible on the dashboard and that the driver uses the meter. Don\u2019t accept lifts from strangers.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid poorly lit or remote areas. Gang muggings, carjackings and armed robberies have occurred, including on busy streets. A number of foreign nationals (including one British national) have gone missing in recent years, with some related to criminal activity.</p>\n\n<p>Car theft and theft from cars are common, even during relatively short stops at restaurant and other car parks. Don\u2019t leave valuables in hire cars, even in the boot, and avoid leaving belongings where they can be seen from outside the car. Park in secure car parks with visible security staff, or in well-lit busy areas. There have been incidents where slashed tyres have given thieves the opportunity to help change your vehicle\u2019s tyres while an accomplice steals from the car.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"methanol-poisoning\">Methanol poisoning</h3>\n\n<p>In 2019, there were a number of deaths and cases of serious illness in Costa Rica caused by alcoholic drinks containing methanol. Criminal gangs have been reported to manufacture bottles of alcohol containing high amounts of methanol. These included a number of cheap brands of local spirits, such as vodka and \u2018guaro\u2019 (cane liquor). Further incidents -were reported in October 2020 involving a spirit of the \u201cFiesta Blanca\u201d brand. You should take care when buying all spirit-based drinks.</p>\n\n<p>The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) says \u201cMethanol can cause headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. High doses can cause blindness or vision loss as a consequence of serious damage to the optic nerve. Chronic exposure may cause liver damage, cirrhosis or even death from respiratory or cardiac failure\u201d. If you, or someone you\u2019re travelling with, shows signs of alcohol-induced methanol poisoning, seek immediate medical attention.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting jungle areas you should go with an experienced local guide. If you visit a volcano pay strict attention to restrictions on entry to dangerous areas. When there is the risk of an eruption the national park is closed to visitors until the danger has passed.</p>\n\n<p>Emergency contact numbers are:  Police Emergency - 911; Ambulance - 911 or 128; Fire Service - 911 or 118; Police Investigative Service - 911 or 2221-5337.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>While air accidents in Costa Rica are rare, there have been 2 fatal incidents since September 2017 involving the domestic airline Nature Air. The company\u2019s operating certificate has been indefinitely suspended by Costa Rica\u2019s civil aviation authority.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Costa Rica on a UK Driving Licence or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> while visiting as a tourist.  If resident for longer periods, you may need to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://licenciascr.com/conducir/licencia-extranjera-homologacion/\">get a Costa Rican licence</a>. You should produce your driving licence and passport if requested to do so by a police officer.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to enter the country in a right hand drive vehicle, you should be aware there have been instances where such vehicles have been refused entry as they contravene local law and are ineligible for local insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are generally good on main routes, although there can be potholes due to heavy rains in the rainy season. Landslides in the rainy season sometimes block the road between San Jos\u00e9 and Guapiles on the way to Lim\u00f3n and the San Jose/Caldera Highway. Take care when approaching bridges as these are often only one-way, even if the road is two-way.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is lower than in the UK. Accidents are often caused by speeding or overtaking irresponsibly. Traffic lights are often ignored. Traffic police strictly enforce speed limits. If you have an accident where somebody has been injured or where blame has not been accepted by the other driver, you must not move the vehicle until the traffic police have arrived. The Traffic Police (Transito - telephone 2222-9330 or 2222-9245) and the Insurance Investigator (INS - telephone 800-800-8000) must come to the scene of the accident to complete accident reports.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals sometimes cause deliberate collisions as a means of stopping vehicles in order to commit robberies or other crimes. If you think a collision was a deliberate act by another driver to make you stop, consider driving on until you reach a safe place like a police station or garage. In these circumstances you will need to be able to explain your actions to the traffic police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-and-water-sports\">Swimming and water sports</h3>\n\n<p>Take extra care if participating in tours involving snorkeling or similar activities. There have been recent fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst swimming from all beaches in Costa Rica, bear in mind that rip tides are very common and there are often no lifeguards. You should seek reliable local advice. Drownings are the second most common cause of accidental death and in recent years have averaged 50 to 60 per year, a third of whom were tourists.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular sightings of crocodiles along the Pacific Coast near beaches popular with surfers (from Playa Azul down to Playa Esterillos) and there have been attacks in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adventure-activities-sea-and-river-travel\">Adventure activities, sea and river travel</h3>\n\n<p>Safety standards for adventure activities and on small boats are not always of a high standard. There have been several incidents involving small boats in the Tortuguero area, including a fatality due to a falling tree.
