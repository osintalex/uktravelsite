Keep large amounts of money, expensive jewellery, cameras and cell phones out of sight. Don\u2019t change large sums of money in busy public areas. Keep copies of important documents, including passports, in a separate place. Beware of pickpockets in town centres.</p>\n\n<p>There have been cases of credit card skimming at some hotels and lodges around the country.

If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel. If you hire a car, pay particular attention to the insurance cover provided. Most policies will not cover accidents that do not involve other vehicles or animals. Given the higher than normal probability of an accident on a gravel road because of its condition, you should take out fully comprehensive insurance on any hired vehicle. You are not allowed to use a mobile phone whilst driving.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of fatal accidents on gravel/dirt roads. \u00a0Don\u2019t exceed 80kmh on gravel. Punctures are common. If possible, carry 2 spare tyres and plenty of water.</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (normally January to April) many gravel roads deteriorate. Check with your destination on the local road conditions before setting off. \u00a0Avoid driving at night outside towns as wildlife and stray livestock pose a serious hazard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adventure-sports\">Adventure sports</h3>\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance covers you for any adventure activities you plan to undertake (eg quad biking, dune boarding and hot air ballooning).</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in Namibia, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.
