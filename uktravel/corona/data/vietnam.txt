Consider splitting key items between bags.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals have reported a number of personal attacks, including rape and sexual assault in areas popular with expatriates and tourists. When reporting such attacks in Vietnam, compared to the UK there is a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual, especially when the victim had consumed alcohol or where the alleged attacker was known to the victim.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been some reports of foreign women being victims of indecent assault and harassment (including inappropriate touching and groping), particularly while walking alone. You should take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of arguments over hotel, restaurant or taxi bills turning violent or abusive. It is well worth researching places to stay before you arrive. To avoid potential disputes, make sure you are clear about the level of service you can expect to receive and any associated charges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>A number of British and foreign visitors have died in Vietnam while engaged in adventure tourism in rural and mountainous areas. Some terrain can be hazardous and remote from rescue services of any kind. And the rainy season - see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/vietnam/natural-disasters\">Natural Disasters</a> - can quickly and significantly increase risk, especially for localised flooding, navigating swollen streams and rivers and landslides. Safety standards are generally lower than in the UK and compliance varies. Don\u2019t stray off main routes and, where required, take a reputable guide. Always follow safety guidelines and check local weather forecasts before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid illegal tour guides who have been known to offer tours and activities prohibited under local regulations. In some areas local regulations require the use of a guide. Make sure your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel insurance</a> covers your planned activity fully.</p>\n\n<p>Travel is restricted near military installations and some areas of Vietnam are fairly inaccessible. If you wish to visit a village, commune or ward that is close to the border you may need to get permission from the provincial police department. Contact the relevant local authority for more information.</p>\n\n<p>Unexploded mines and ordnance are a continuing hazard in former battlefields, particularly in central Vietnam and along the Laos Border, formerly traversed by the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Mined areas are often unmarked.</p>\n\n<p>Undertake any leisure activities which include firearms at your own risk and make sure you are supervised by a reputable guide. There have been reports of hearing loss from those close to these activities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling by motorbikes in Vietnam carries significant risk. There are frequent road traffic accidents and fatal crashes. According to World Health Organisation statistics, you are over 8 times more likely to be killed in a road traffic accident in Vietnam than in the UK (an estimated 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people in Vietnam compared to 3.1 per 100,000 people in the UK).</p>\n\n<p>A number of British nationals have died in motorbike accidents in Vietnam, and many more have been involved in accidents, with some injured very seriously. Before choosing to drive a motorbike in Vietnam, it is essential that you\u2019re an experienced motorbike rider, have a good quality motorbike helmet, understand the roads on which you plan to travel and that your travel insurance covers your planned activity.</p>\n\n<p>Compliance with local road regulations is poor. You\u2019re advised to keep your speed down and to be prepared for the unexpected. If you\u2019re planning on travelling as a passenger on a motorbike, please wear a good quality helmet and make sure your medical insurance is comprehensive. It\u2019s illegal to be on a motorbike without a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a traffic accident, you could face criminal charges and you may need to pay compensation to the injured person even if the injuries are minor. If you\u2019re involved in an accident or subject to an investigation, offer the police your full co-operation and inform the British Embassy in Hanoi or Consulate General in Hoi Chi Minh City.</p>\n\n<p>As of 28 March 2019, if you wish to drive cars or ride motorbikes in Vietnam you will need to present your UK driving licence and a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">UK-issued International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. If you\u2019re a long term resident in Vietnam, you can qualify for a Vietnamese driving licence with a diplomatic ID, temporary residence card or residence card validity for 3 months or more and also a valid UK driving licence or UK-issued IDP. Applications for a Vietnamese driving licence can be made at the local offices of the Department of Public Works and Transportation.</p>\n\n<p>You should also make sure you have third-party insurance as required by Vietnamese law.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t use your passport as a deposit for hiring vehicles or in place of a fine in the event of a traffic offence.</p>\n\n<p>Metered taxis from larger firms are generally reliable. There are many taxi operators and meters are set at different prices. The meter should start at around 8,000 to 20,000 VND, depending on the size of the taxi. Where possible get hotels or restaurants to book you a reputable taxi. Always make sure the driver identifies themselves before setting off. If you book a taxi online or through an app, make sure the details of the vehicle and driver match those provided by the company.</p>\n\n<p>Overcharging for taxi journeys in and around the tourist hotspots in the Old Quarter of Hanoi and at Hanoi Airport is regularly reported. The same occurs at Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s airport and popular tourist attractions. Check the published fares near the taxi stands before starting your journey or consider booking a taxi or ordering one via an online app.</p>\n\n<p>Bus and coach crashes are not unusual and increase in regularity at night. Vehicles are often poorly maintained. When travelling by bus be vigilant against petty theft as there have been reported cases of people losing passports and personal belongings while travelling on night buses. Be cautious about offers of free transfers to hotels unless organised in advance, as these are likely to be bogus.</p>\n\n<p>Driving cars or riding motorcycles when the blood alcohol concentration is more than zero is illegal as from 1 January 2020. This is being enforced rigorously.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Rail travel in Vietnam is generally reliable. Be aware of the risks of petty theft, particularly while asleep on overnight trains.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Safety regulations and standards vary greatly and are not at the same level as the United Kingdom. Check with your tour guide about the safety record and registration of boats, and the certification of personnel before setting off. Make sure you receive a full safety briefing when joining any boat. Consider safety standards carefully before taking an overnight boat trip on Halong Bay as some boats have sunk quickly and without warning.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy in coastal areas off Vietnam is very rare. Mariners should, however, report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>Vietnam has a single party political system, which does not welcome dissent. Some protests in recent years have turned violent, or been violently suppressed by the authorities. You should avoid all protests.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>Providing prompt consular assistance can be difficult outside Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on a case by case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices.

The costs of quarantine, both in government centres and designated hotels, must be paid by those arriving or their employers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"land-borders\">Land borders</h3>\n<p>Borders with China, Cambodia and Laos are currently closed except for the import and export of goods.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transiting-vietnam\">Transiting Vietnam</h3>\n<p>Currently transit in Vietnam is not allowed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"data-collection\">Data collection</h3>\n<p>Those arriving in Vietnam are required to provide information about recent travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"testing-on-departure\">Testing on departure</h3>\n<p>There is no requirement for testing on departure though anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n<p>If you want to stay in Vietnam, you should only do so legally and with the right visa and permission to stay. Immigration offices are open and working normally.</p>\n\n<p>Vietnamese visit visas are issued to foreign nationals for a limited duration and on the basis that visitors must leave on or before the date of expiry. Those who come to Vietnam to work are required to apply for a work visa / permit. You should check the visa validity and conditions carefully. Overstaying your Vietnamese visit visa is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid, and may be prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The Embassy and Consulate General will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations. For those with a valid work visa or resident cards, you can extend these at immigration offices with the assistance and support of your family or employer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n<p>Your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months on the date you enter Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>A number of British nationals have been refused entry and exit due to their passport being damaged. Make sure your passport is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/damaged-and-faulty-passports/damaged-and-faulty-passports-policy\">in good condition</a> before arriving in Vietnam.  Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.</p>\n\n<p>In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Vietnamese Immigration Department has received assurances from the British Government that any passport held by a British national with an expiry date of 1 January 2020 onwards, or with less than 6 months validity, would be valid until 31 December 2021, when submitted for the purpose of renewing a visa or residence permit. This continues to be valid for all passports held by British nationals. However, because you can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport\">renew your passport online</a>, and the visa application centres in Vietnam have now reopened, we still recommend that you renew your passport if required.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quarantine-requirements\">Quarantine requirements</h3>\n<p>Quarantine is mandatory for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus inside Vietnam and for most coming to Vietnam for 14 days or more. There are special arrangements for those coming to Vietnam for less than 14 days and which will be decided on a case by case basis. Vietnamese government quarantine centres are basic. Most do not meet Public Health England standards. In principle there are provisions for people who are exceptionally allowed to enter the country for work to be allowed to undertake quarantine in a hotel approved by the Ministry of Health. However, this is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>The Vietnamese government has confirmed that anyone entering Vietnam from 1 September 2020 must pay for quarantine costs both in government centres and in designated hotels. You will also be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs.</p>\n\n<p>Vietnam\u2019s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed or assist in the reservation of, or transfer to, hotels used for quarantine. Violations carry strict penalties.</p>\n\n<p>Quarantine lasts a minimum of 14 days and could be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Following discharge you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. You should expect to be tested at least 5 times prior to release, and will be required to produce 3 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and a further two consecutive negative tests during self-isolation.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>Vietnam uses community testing as a means to provide assurance that COVID-19 is not being transmitted undetected. Should you be asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"regular-entry-requirements\">Regular entry requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"registration\">Registration</h3>\n<p>When checking into a hotel, you\u2019ll have to hand over your passport so that the hotel can register your presence with the local police. Make sure your passport is returned and keep it in a safe place. Don\u2019t use your passport as a deposit for renting a hotel room. If you are staying in private accommodation, you will still be expected to register. Ask your host to help you with this as soon as you arrive. You may be fined if you don\u2019t register.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/240/vietnam#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"uk-emergency-travel-documents\">UK Emergency Travel Documents</h3>\n<p>UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Vietnam. Please contact the nearest Vietnamese Embassy to obtain an appropriate visa before travel. If your ETD has been issued in Vietnam, to replace a lost/stolen passport, you will need an exit visa from the Vietnam Immigration Department before you can travel out of Vietnam. This process normally takes 5 working days.

Same-sex relationships are not criminalised by law and changing gender is recognised by Vietnam\u2019s Civil Code. Vietnam abolished a ban on same-sex marriage in 2015, although same-sex couples are neither recognised nor protected by law.  In parts of society LGBT rights and issues are still more tolerated than accepted, but Vietnamese society has become significantly more tolerant in recent years.

These include medicine that can be used for the treatment of addiction, to treat anxiety, depression, insomnia and other conditions. The rules say that you must not have more than the quantity prescribed by a doctor for 7 days (addictive medicine) or 10 days (psychotropic medicine). The prescription should be in English or Vietnamese and include your name and age and list the name, volume and dosage of the medicine(s). It must also include the doctor\u2019s signature or address.
