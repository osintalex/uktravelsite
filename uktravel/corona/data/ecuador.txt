In Quito, take particular care in \u2018La Carolina\u2019 and \u2018El Ejido\u2019 parks, the districts of \u2018La Mariscal\u2019 (Plaza Foch), \u2018La Floresta\u2019 and \u2018La Marin\u2019, the bus terminals and the old town including the main square and \u2018El Panecillo\u2019 hill. Avoid travelling to  \u2018El Panecillo\u2019 hill on your own or by foot. Use one of the standard tours or reliable transport instead. In Guayaquil, be particularly careful in Urdesa, Kennedy, Alborada, and the Malecon Simon Bolivar districts (including Cerro Santa Ana) and the bus terminal. Do not resist robbery or mugging.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t wear expensive jewellery when walking around, carry only the money you need for the day and take care of your credit cards. Watch your bags on public transport (including on interstate bus journeys) and wear your rucksack on the front of your body. Where possible, don\u2019t store anything under your seat or in the overhead storage on buses.</p>\n\n<p>Carry a colour copy of your passport, including the visa entry stamp page, and keep the original safe. Only take out as much money as you need.</p>\n\n<p>Look after your belongings. Methods of distraction include requests for assistance, staged fights and pushing or shoving. Don\u2019t resist a robbery.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when withdrawing money from a bank or at an ATM. There have been cases of violent robbery outside banks in Quito in 2018 and 2019. The Ecuadorean national police offers a free escort service from/to banks when large amounts are involved. You are encouraged to use this service, which you can request by calling 911.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of attacks and serious sexual assault against foreign women have increased in the city of Monta\u00f1ita (Santa Elena province in the east of Ecuador). All visitors, particularly women, should take extra care to find reputable and secure accommodation whether travelling alone or as a group. Avoid travelling after dark and be alert to the use of date rape and other drugs in drinks. If you feel unwell, seek urgent help from people you know.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals often use drugs to subdue victims. Home-made versions of the drug \u2018scopolamine\u2019 leave victims in a subdued, compliant state and cause amnesia. Be wary if you\u2019re approached by a stranger offering you food, drinks, leaflets, perfume samples, telephone cards or cigarettes, no matter how friendly or well dressed they appear.</p>\n\n<p>Armed robbery is a risk throughout Ecuador, but especially in Quito, Guayaquil and in remote areas. Seek local advice about the safety of the area you are visiting and travel in a group whenever possible.</p>\n\n<p>Quito has a Tourism Police unit with branches in the north and old town of the city but also at the airport and bus terminals. The Ministry of Tourism has a national tourist service complaints management system e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:denuncias@turismo.gob.ec\">denuncias@turismo.gob.ec</a></p>\n\n<p>The Ecuador District Attorney\u00b4s Office (Fiscalia General) now has an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/denuncias-on-line-para-turistas/\">English online tool</a> for tourists to report robbery, theft and loss of belongings and documents (the tool is listed under \u2018Denuncias online para touristas).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transport-safety\">Transport safety</h3>\n\n<p>\u201cZebra crossings\u201d are usually not respected by drivers throughout Ecuador. Pedestrians are recommended to exercise extra caution when crossing roads.</p>\n\n<p>There is a range of options for travelling by bus throughout Ecuador. Public interstate buses operate all over Ecuador, as well as hop on hop off guided bus tours.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of robberies on interstate transport and at bus stations, especially Quito, Ba\u00f1os, Cuenca, Tena, Riobamba, Mindo and Loja tourist towns. Most incidents took place at night. Where possible you should avoid travelling by road after dark. Cases involving British nationals have been reported on the routes between Quito and Ba\u00f1os; Ba\u00f1os and Cuenca; Ba\u00f1os and Quito; Guayaquil and Ba\u00f1os; Ba\u00f1os and Lago Agrio; Tena to Quito; Quito and Mindo; Quito and Cuenca; and Loja and Vilcabamba. Don\u00b4t store your bag in overhead luggage space or underneath your seat. Keep your valuables in a safe place, preferably in a money belt or safe inside pocket.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid taking interstate buses with a reputation for stopping to pick up passengers at night as many criminals use this means to attack passengers.</p>\n\n<p>Express kidnappings - short-term opportunistic abductions, aimed at extracting cash from the victim - also occur, particularly in Quito and Guayaquil. Victims can be targeted or selected at random and held while criminals empty their bank accounts with stolen cash cards. This type of crime can involve illegitimate and registered taxis. Ecuadoreans and foreign visitors are targets.</p>\n\n<p>The use of unregistered taxis significantly increases the risk of becoming a victim of crime. Try to book a taxi through your hotel or by calling a known radio taxi service. Where possible, try to travel in a group. If you are using an authorised taxi (yellow cab) in Quito and Guayaquil make sure it has the municipality registration number sticker displayed on the windscreen and doors; the orange license plates or the new white plates with an orange strip on the top and video cameras inside. Avoid hailing a taxi on the street, especially at night. Larger supermarkets and airports have taxi ranks.</p>\n\n<p>In mid-2013, the Ecuadorean National Transit Agency launched the \u2018Secure Transport\u2019 project throughout Ecuador. This includes the installation of security kits - video cameras, panic buttons and GPS - inside interstate buses and registered taxis. You should only use the yellow registered taxis, with the \u2018transporte seguro\u2019 logo, if a radio taxi isn\u2019t available.</p>\n\n<p>You can also order a secure taxi from new free smartphone applications \u2018Easy Taxi,\u2019 available for Android and iPhone. A photo, the name of the taxi driver and the vehicle description will be sent to the customer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>There is a 20 km exclusion zone, under army control, along the entire border with Colombia. The FCDO advise against all travel to this area, except the official border crossing town of Tulcan in Carchi province. Guerrilla groups, drug traffickers and criminal gangs are active and there is a risk of kidnapping and a high risk of crime. Foreigners, including oil workers, are potential targets.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018 there were serious attacks within the exclusion zone, in the northern province of Esmeraldas. These have included 2 bomb explosions and a kidnapping of local journalists in the San Lorenzo and Mataje areas. The Ecuadorian authorities have declared these attacks to be terrorist incidents. For more details, see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/ecuador/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>The security situation in Esmereldas Province can change very quickly. On 4 April 2018, a home-made explosive was detonated in the town of Viche, near a bridge on one of the main roads connecting the highlands to the coast and various popular beach destinations. If you\u2019re undertaking essential travel in this area, you should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Ecuadorean authorities, be particularly cautious and vigilant, and monitor this travel advice regularly.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re crossing the northern border at Tulcan (Rumichaca official land border point), Carchi province, you should enter and exit the town via the main Panamericana international highway. Lago Agrio (also known as Nueva Loja), the main town in the border province of Sucumbios, and San Lorenzo, in the border province of Esmeraldas, both lie within the 20km zone.</p>\n\n<p>The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to the area bordering Colombia in Carchi province inside the 20km exclusion zone. The border area in Carchi province is home to various eco-lodges, near El Angel Ecological Reserve. Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are present in the area. If you\u2019re travelling to this area, make sure you travel with a reputable operator with good communication systems, emergency plans in place and an official guide.</p>\n\n<p>The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to the area of Tarapoa and the Cuyabeno reserve in Sucumbios. In February 2012 a group of tourists including British nationals were assaulted at gunpoint by a criminal gang in the Cuyabeno reserve. In September 2012 a group of tourists were robbed and 2 tourists were kidnapped in the Cuyabeno reserve but subsequently released.</p>\n\n<p>There is a higher risk of crime in southern parts of Sucumbios province, including Coca (also known as Francisco de Orellana). There are popular eco-lodges in the area along the Napo river, between Sucumbios and Orellana provinces. Use only reputable operators to visit this area. Some lodges are a long distance from the nearest major hospital and helicopter evacuation may be necessary in an emergency. Reputable eco-lodges in this area have good communications and emergency plans in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"telecommunications\">Telecommunications</h3>\n\n<p>The Ecuadorean Ministry of Tourism and the National Telecommunications Corporation (CNT) have launched a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cnt.gob.ec/movil/plan/cnt-chip-turista/\">Tourist SIM card</a> (\u201ctravel SIM\u201d) available for purchase for smartphones or tablets, aiming to provide tourists with various services during a 30 day period. It includes 1GB of data, free Facebook and Whatsapp, and voice call/SMS credit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volunteer-and-adventure-activities\">Volunteer and adventure activities</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re joining a \u2018volunteer\u2019 or \u2018adventure expedition\u2019 programme, where possible make sure the UK organisation responsible for the travel has an official local agent in Ecuador with sufficient autonomy and resources to handle an emergency situation. Be wary of unauthorised intermediaries \u2018enganchadores\u2019 trying to offer you cheap hotels or tour deals.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to undertake adventure activities like canopy, bungee jumping, quad biking, rafting or kayaking, make sure you are fit and healthy for the activity. Use a reputable local tour operator, properly accredited to provide this service (with a specific licence). Check that the equipment is in good condition. In addition, for water adventure sports, ensure  that the operator provides you with an accredited specialised guide and that the weather condition and river currents are within the advisable standards. In May 2012 and January 2016, 2 foreign tourists died in Mindo and Bucay areas due to canopy accidents. In 2017 and 2018, 2 British tourists died while undertaking rafting and kayaking activities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiking\">Hiking</h3>\n\n<p>Due to high altitude and unpredictable climates, if you are hiking in Ecuador, including the Galapagos Islands, you should be well prepared and sufficiently fit and healthy.  Ascend at a more moderate rate to give your body some time to adjust. Stay well hydrated. Don\u2019t stray from established paths and avoid exploring remote areas without an experienced guide. Make sure someone knows where you\u2019re going and when you expect you will be back.</p>\n\n<p>The telef\u00e9rico (cable car) from Quito to Pichincha volcano, that overlooks the city (at 4,050 metres above sea level), is a popular day trip from the capital. However, there have been some accidents, including fatalities from hypothermia. You should take warm and waterproof clothing, as well as high factor sun block \u2013 even on a clear day, as the weather can change quickly \u2013 and take an accredited specialised guide who knows the route well. Where possible, try to start the excursion early to minimise any potential risks related to unexpected heavy mist or storms. Tourists have been killed by electrical storms while climbing Pichincha, so you should pay close attention to the weather, and re-consider your plans if conditions look bad.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"use-of-traditional-hallucinogens\">Use of traditional hallucinogens</h3>\n\n<p>Traditional <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhsinform.co.uk/health-library/articles/d/drug-misuse/introduction/\">hallucinogens</a>, often referred to as Ayahuasca or San Pedro, are found in Ecuador. These substances are often marketed to tourists as \u2018spiritual cleansing\u2019, and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that\u2019s illegal in the UK and many other countries. There are many risks involved. Consumption isn\u2019t regulated. Intoxicated travellers have been assaulted and robbed. Health risks are not well understood, and on occasions people have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases deaths after taking these drugs, which are often taken a long way from medical facilities making the risks even greater.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive a hire car using a UK licence or <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit.</a></p>\n\n<p>The Ecuadorean police recommend that you also get a local temporary driver permit. Always carry your passport, driving licence, vehicle registration and proof of insurance with you when in the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are variable. Heavy rains and mudslides often close or wash away roads, which can cause significant delays and accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Serious accidents are very common, mainly due to careless driving, speeding and badly maintained vehicles. Ecuador has one of the highest rates of road accidents in Latin America. In May 2014, near Papallacta region, a road collision involving a bus carrying foreign tourists caused the deaths of 2 British nationals and injury to others. Similar accidents in the same route were reported in 2018. In March 2018, a bus crash on the Guayaquil to Quito route caused 11 deaths and 54 injured people, including 2 British nationals who were seriously harmed. In the same week, there was another critical road collision in Manabi province resulting in 12 deaths.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a passenger in a vehicle travelling at an unsafe speed, you should firmly instruct the driver to slow down.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible, avoid travelling by road outside major cities after dark. If you take public buses, check the reputation of the bus company and make sure it\u2019s insured with a \u2018SPPAT\u2019 (formerly SOAT), mandatory traffic accident public insurance. There is an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.multipasajes.com/\">online interstate bus booking system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When taking yellow registered taxis in the major cities make sure the taxi meter is reset. The minimum charge in Quito is US$1.45 during the day and US$1.75 at night, even if the meter registers less for your journey. If you or the hotel called a taxi, agree a price before you get in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>The national rail company, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.trenecuador.com/\">Tren Ecuador</a>, offers a range of train routes along the Andean and coastal regions in Ecuador.

Journey times from the airport to central Quito can vary from 30 to 60 minutes depending on the time of day.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US and Netherlands authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in and around Ecuador\u2019s waters. Sailors should be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several serious accidents in the Galapagos Islands involving boats operated by tour companies. Even for short journeys, you should use reputable boat transport operators and ask about safety features before making a booking. Check that life boats and the life vests are provided before boarding.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Street demonstrations, protests and strikes are common.

Even though the national state of emergency (\u201cestado de excepci\u00f3n\u201d) ended on 12 September, the visa agreement is still in force due to the further 90 day extension of the national health emergency (Acuerdo 57) on 13 September.</p>\n\n<p>From 12 December 2020, visitors will have 30 days either to leave the country without paying a fine, or to apply for a temporary visa instead, through a formal application with the MFA. Visitors aiming to remain in Ecuador are strongly encouraged to start the process before the 30 day period to avoid delays due to expected high demand for this service from the MFA.</p>\n\n<p>The visitors\u2019 extension (\u201cpr\u00f3rrogas\u201d) managed by the Immigration officials may be no longer applicable, as the maximum extension period to remain in Ecuador without a formal visa is 180 days. However, for any general enquiries contact: <a href=\"mailto:servicios.migratorios@ministeriodegobierno.gob.ec\">servicios.migratorios@ministeriodegobierno.gob.ec</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The MFA has implemented an appointment system for residence visa renewals and other services in Quito: <a href=\"mailto:citasvisas@cancilleria.gob.ec\">citasvisas@cancilleria.gob.ec</a>. For more information:  call +593 (2) 3993 200 ext. 23007 and 23015 or +593 (2) 3933 520.

On arrival in the country, you\u2019ll normally be allowed to remain in Ecuador for up to 90 days per year.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to stay for longer, you should apply for a visa from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://londres.consulado.gob.ec/contactos/\">Ecuadorean Embassy in London</a> (or from another Ecuadorean embassy overseas) before you travel. You can extend your 90 days for a further 90 days (before the first period expires) only once and by paying a fee. If you want to change your immigration status, by applying for another type of visa, you can do so at the Ecuadorean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility before the 90 or 180 days expires.</p>\n\n<p>The penalty for overstaying involves a fine. As with other immigration offences, if the fine is not paid, you will not be able to return to Ecuador for 2 years and your name will remain on immigration records. If the fine is paid, you can return with an official visa issued by an Ecuadorean Embassy overseas. The relevant deportation local regulation is still under consideration.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to work or study in Ecuador, check visa requirements with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://londres.consulado.gob.ec/contactos/\">Ecuadorean Embassy in London</a> before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>As of January 2019, permanent and temporary resident visas are issued electronically. Ecuadorean visas are no longer stuck in passports. The online visa is sent by email to be printed out. The immigration authorities have access to online visa records.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter Ecuador via the border with Peru or Colombia, you must insist on being given an official entry stamp at the border showing the date of your arrival. There have been cases of buses not stopping at the border, which has caused great difficulties for foreign visitors for failing to comply with immigration regulations.  Travellers may need to return to the border entry point to get the required stamp and entry registration. If there is no exit stamp from the country you are coming from, in principle the Ecuadorean immigration officials cannot give you an entry stamp, thus you will be denied entry.</p>\n\n<p>Although local regulations may not always be implemented, all visitors to the Galapagos Islands should provide a copy of their hotel booking. Likewise, visitors staying with local residents in the islands should have an invitation letter from their host available. The maximum stay in this region as a tourist is 60 days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n<p>Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from your date of entry. This is a strict legal requirement from the Ecuadorean government. If your passport does not meet this requirement, you will be denied entry to Ecuador.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"uk-emergency-travel-documents\">UK Emergency Travel Documents</h3>\n<p>UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are also accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ecuador.

In non-straightforward situations due to a legal dispute, the child will need a judicial written permission (Autorizaci\u00f3n de Viaje Judicial) issued by a judge (Juzgado de la Ni\u00f1ez y Adolescencia). If one of the parents is deceased, the other parent would need to submit the death certificate to a public notary, so that an indefinite notarial permit to travel with the child is issued. The immigration authorities are responsible for checking all the above legal documents.</p>\n\n<p>British children (or British-Ecuadorean dual nationals) who have tourist status do not need these permissions.</p>\n", "slug": "entry-requirements", "title": "Entry requirements"}, {"body": "\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p><strong>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Ecuador on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/70/ecuador\">TravelHealthPro website</a></p>\n\n<p>See the healthcare information in the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/educador/coronavirus\">Coronavirus section</a> for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Ecuador.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> on the TravelHealthPro website.

Don\u00b4t underestimate the effects of high altitude on your body. Be aware of higher exposure to UV radiation.  In January 2020 the levels of UV radiation have significantly increased throughout Ecuador. You should use high factor sunblock, wear long sleeved clothing and keep very well hydrated. Use high factor sunblock and keep well hydrated.  If you plan to travel to altitudes over 2,500 metres discuss the health risks associated with travelling to high altitude with your GP before you travel.

This might include obtaining access to anti-viral medicine or to seek medical advice. Private treatment can be very expensive and private hospitals will demand a credit card guarantee for admission. The Ecuadorean public healthcare system provides the same level of assistance to locals and foreigners, at no cost. However, good/specialised medical treatment may not always be available outside the main cities.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel and medical insurance</a> and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. For life threatening emergencies, in principle every private or public health institution is obliged by law to assist patients.</p>\n\n<p>There are limited facilities on the Galapagos Islands. If you travel to the Galapagos make sure your insurance includes evacuation by air ambulance. San Cristobal island has a well-equipped public hospital, but Santa Cruz island only has a basic hospital.

On Tuesday 28 May 2019, 6 minor tremors were reported in the north-western part of Quito. The strong, but short, tremors were connected to Quito\u00b4s location on geological faults.  A similar tremor was reported in northern Quito on 8 December 2019, causing landslides on the road to Guayllabamba.

These are flows of water, mud, lava and debris which can be extremely destructive. The town of Latacunga and Salcedo and low-lying areas in the valley to the east of Quito are particularly vulnerable (Los Chillos and Rumi\u00f1ahui).</p>\n\n<p>Ecuadorean law stipulates that anyone wishing to climb a glaciated mountain must be accompanied by an officially accredited guide.</p>\n\n<p>You should review your itinerary taking into account information from the Ecuadorean National Geophysical Institute and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/\">National Service of Risk and Emergency Management</a>.

The yellow alerts for Morona Santiago and Chimborazo provinces remain in place (issued on 5 December 2019 and 16 June 2020 respectively).  You should follow instructions issued by the local authorities, including, for example, wearing masks and goggles, and keeping away from the volcano and the Upano river.

No impact on tourists was expected given that the volcano is located on an uninhabited island.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rainy-seasons\">Rainy seasons</h3>\n\n<p>Rainy season usually runs from December to May. The irregular \u2018El Ni\u00f1o\u2019 climatic phenomenon occurs every few years and can cause unusually heavy rains, widespread flooding and a hotter climate across Ecuador. The risk of landslides is higher at times of heavy rainfall.</p>\n\n<p>During a heavy rainy seasons, you should monitor local media and discuss your itinerary with your tour operator to avoid disruption. You should also avoid crossing rivers due to potential strong currents and take care in affected areas. In the coastal region you should seek local advice on tidal activity and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Forest fires occur in many areas of Ecuador, but especially in Pichincha province.
