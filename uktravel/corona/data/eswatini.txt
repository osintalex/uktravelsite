Vehicles have been taken at gunpoint. Avoid walking in the downtown areas of Mbabane and Manzini after dark and do not travel around in remote rural areas unless in a group. There is often an increase in criminal activity during the festive season.</p>\n\n<p>Keep valuables in a safe place and avoid carrying large amounts of money or wearing conspicuous jewellery.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling into or out of Eswatini by road at night. There have been numerous incidences of car hijackings on major routes from South Africa and Mozambique.</p>\n\n<p>The political situation is generally stable, but there are occasional political demonstrations. Some political parties have been banned and designated as terrorist organisations. Avoid gatherings as these can be dispersed forcefully by the police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licences or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is lower than in the UK. Drivers often cross the central reservation to avoid obstructions. Speeding is a problem (the maximum speed limit is 120 km on motorways and 80 km on other unrestricted roads). Minor roads are not well maintained and road markings are poor.</p>\n\n<p>Take care on rural roads; there have been a number of serious accidents and deaths as a result of animals straying onto roads. Avoid driving on rural roads at night. As well as the possibility of hitting animals, there is the additional risk of abandoned unlit trailers and poorly lit heavy vehicles.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nBe wary of anyone who offers you help if you breakdown or need to change a tyre as it presents the opportunity for theft, muggings and hijackings. You should park in well-lit areas. Do not pick up strangers. Do not stop to assist apparently distressed motorists, as this is a technique sometimes used by hijackers. Instead, report the incident to the police.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel in a vehicle other than one registered in Eswatini, you will have to complete a customs declaration form at border posts on entry and departure. A road fund levy of E50 is payable at the border. You must carry with you in the vehicle at all times proof of your customs declaration and payment of the road fund levy. Vehicles may be searched at borders.</p>\n\n<p>Do not use public transport (buses and taxis). Vehicles are generally poorly maintained and overloaded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.</p>\n\n<p>We can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices.
