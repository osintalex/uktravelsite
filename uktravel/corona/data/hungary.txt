Bag snatching and pick-pocketing are common, especially in Budapest. Be particularly careful on busy public transport, in train stations, at markets and at other places frequented by tourists. Theft of and from vehicles is common. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash.</p>\n\n<p>Always ask to see the menu and price list before ordering drinks or food and check your bill carefully before settling up. Some restaurants and bars have been known to charge extortionate amounts and take tourists to cash points to demand more money. You should report any such incident to the police.</p>\n\n<p>Some taxi drivers are accomplices in these frauds. They may receive a commission to recommend certain bars, clubs and restaurants to passengers. Never ask a taxi driver to recommend a bar or club. If a driver offers to take you to one, or you are approached on the street with an invitation to enter a club, treat that advice with caution. As a general rule it is better to phone for a taxi from a reputable local company. Be careful in establishments where menus do not properly display prices.</p>\n\n<p>There have been some reported instances of drinks being spiked. Be sure to buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport-in-budapest\">Public transport in Budapest</h3>\n<p>Foreign visitors are often caught out by the ticket system in Budapest, and fined by ticket inspectors. Follow the passenger information notices, which are usually printed in English. Validate your ticket before starting your journey (before you get to the platform if travelling by Metro; and immediately after boarding buses, trams or trolley buses). Keep your ticket until the end of your journey and show it to inspectors on request. You have to validate another ticket every time you change lines.</p>\n\n<p>A special ticket is required for use on the night service network.</p>\n\n<p>All passengers on public transport in Budapest should wear a face mask, with the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Fines of around \u00a340 can be levied for non-compliance.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on ticket conditions and prices, visit the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bkv.hu/\">Budapest Transport Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>In 2019 there were 603 road deaths in the Hungary (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>).
