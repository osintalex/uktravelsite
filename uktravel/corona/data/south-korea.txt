However, there has been no senior-level engagement since the meetings held between US President Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong Un in February and June 2019, and both the level of tension and the security situation on the Korean Peninsula can still change with little notice.  Tensions can rise during the regular South Korean-US military exercises, which take place throughout the year. You should follow the advice of local authorities and keep up to date with developments, including via news broadcasts and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the Korean Peninsula has been divided by a demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the DPRK and the Republic of Korea. Peace has been maintained under an armistice agreement but no formal peace treaty has ever been signed. If you\u2019re in the area of the DMZ, you should exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contingency-planning\">Contingency planning</h2>\n\n<p>At times of increased tensions, you should make yourself familiar with local procedures and preparations, including civil emergency exercises and advice (see below).

Sirens are sounded, transport stopped and some people are asked to take shelter indoors, including in designated metro stations or basements. Shelters in Seoul are marked with a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://postfiles13.naver.net/20130516_268/ukinrok_13686836357750f4jO_PNG/ShelterSign.png?type=w2\">special symbol</a>.

Take care when travelling alone at night and only use legitimate taxis or public transport.</p>\n\n<p>For emergency assistance, or to report a crime, call 112 for police (a 24 hour interpretation service is available) and 119 for ambulance and fire.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"demonstrations\">Demonstrations</h2>\n\n<p>Public demonstrations in South Korea are common. These gatherings are mostly peaceful and well-policed, but you should take extra care as in any crowded place. You should also be aware that under Korean law, foreign nationals are prohibited from engaging in political activities in South Korea.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Under Korean traffic law the maximum blood alcohol content threshold permitted when driving or in charge of a vehicle is  0.03%). This differs to the legal threshold in the UK, which is 0.035%.</p>\n\n<p>All passengers in vehicles must wear seat belts including in rear seats. City buses that are not fitted with seat belts are exempt from this regulation.  From 27 May 2020, government COVID-19 procedures include mandatory wearing of masks in public areas and on all public transport.</p>\n\n<p>Drivers are required to take precautionary measures when parking on hills/slopes (such as placing stops behind each wheel, or turning the steering wheel to ensure that the front wheels of the vehicle are angled towards the kerb).</p>\n\n<p>Further information can be found in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=202073&amp;efYd=20180810#0000\">Korean Road Traffic Act</a>, though there is currently no English translation.

Criminal charges and heavy penalties are common when accidents result in injury, even if guilt is not proved. Watch out for motorcycles travelling at speed on pavements.</p>\n\n<p>Taxi drivers tend to speak little or no English. Although translation services are available, have your destination written in Korean, if possible with a map.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 3,349 road deaths in the South Korea (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>).

Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination.  They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport).</p>\n\n<p>Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"testing--screening-on-arrival\">Testing / screening on arrival</h3>\n<p>All arrivals \u2013 regardless of nationality and length of stay \u2013 are required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) and to undergo quarantine for 14 days. All individuals regardless of nationality who show coronavirus symptoms on arrival will be tested. Those who test positive will be isolated and treated at a hospital or community treatment centre.</p>\n\n<p>For those not showing symptoms on arrival, Korean nationals, and long term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, may self-quarantine at home. Arrivals from the USA and Europe must receive a test within three days; arrivals from elsewhere must receive a test within 14 days.</p>\n\n<p>All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days on arrival. Arrivals from the USA and Europe will be tested on entry before transferring to the quarantine facility; arrivals from elsewhere will move to the quarantine facility and be tested within 14 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 100,000KRW (approximately \u00a366) while in government quarantine facilities.</p>\n\n<p>There is currently no charge for hospital/community centre treatment for those British Nationals testing positive.

The medical certificate must be signed by a medical professional at a recognised medical institution and include the date of the medical examination and either confirmation of a negative test for COVID-19 or a record of the presence or absence of fever, cough, chills, headache, breathing difficulty, muscle pain, and pulmonary symptoms.
