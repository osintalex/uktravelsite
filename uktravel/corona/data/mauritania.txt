Ghazouani was inaugurated on 1 August 2019, marking the first constitutional transfer of power in Mauritania since independence in 1960. You should avoid political gatherings and demonstrations, and follow the advice of local authorities.

See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">Sahel page</a> for information on the Sahel regional threat.</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya, Mauritania and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
