The regulations are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A nationwide curfew between the hours of 11pm and 4am</li>\n  <li>A ban on the use of private cars on Sundays</li>\n  <li>social and family gatherings and visits are prohibited</li>\n  <li>special measures are in place for those under 12 and over 65, and people at risk.</li>\n  <li>children under 12 must stay at home. Each day they are allowed to leave their house for 60 minutes but must remain within 500 meters of their house, and avoid crowded places. When outside, children must be accompanied by an adult who lives with them and maintain a two-meter social distance</li>\n  <li>It is recommended that people over 65 and those who have underlying health conditions must stay at home, with some exceptions; risk groups must not receive visits at home and must avoid the physical contact with people who leave their home</li>\n  <li>everyone must wear face masks outside of homes</li>\n  <li>in addition to wearing a face mask, everyone must wear facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) when on public transport</li>\n  <li>there are several restrictions on the use of beaches.  In Lima and Callao people will be able to access beaches from Monday to Thursday, while respecting social distance and wearing masks.  From Friday to Sunday, access will only be for non-contact aquatic sports, e.g. surfing, sailing.

Be vigilant in public places and when withdrawing cash from ATMs. Avoid walking alone in quiet areas or at night.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of recent thefts at gunpoint affecting foreign nationals, including British tourists and residents. These have happened in tourist areas of Miraflores and Barranco, including outside hotels popular with tourists, during the day and at night. In early 2019 there have also been a small number of robberies in and around luxury lodges near Puerto Maldonado city in the Madre de Dios region, including on tour buses. Some of these have been at gunpoint and involved British tourists. As with travel across the country, you should remain aware of your surroundings and avoid wearing or displaying expensive items. In the event of a robbery, do not attempt to resist attackers or take any action that puts you at greater risk. Report the matter to local police as soon as possible. If the incident takes place in a lodge or hotel, staff will be able to assist.</p>\n\n<p>Passport theft is also common on inter-city buses and at bus stations. Keep your passport with you at all times during your bus journey and take particular care of valuables if you travel on a bus at night. Provincial and inter-city buses are sometimes held up and the passengers robbed.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists have been targeted and robbed by bogus taxi drivers. Do not hail a taxi on the street. Use licensed telephone or internet-based taxi services whenever possible, or ask your hotel to book one for you. Be particularly careful when arriving at Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima, and at bus terminals. Bogus taxi drivers and thieves pretending to be tour operators sometimes approach arriving passengers. At the airport, use one of the official taxi companies located at desks directly outside the arrival hall.  Further details are on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.lima-airport.com/eng/for-passengers/transportation-from-to-the-airport/licensed-taxis\">Lima Airport Partners website</a>. At bus terminals, use one of the taxis registered with them.  Cars travelling from Lima city to the airport have been targeted by thieves when diverted off the main route by GPS navigation applications.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of cases of rape, mostly in the Cusco and Arequipa areas. Be alert to the use of \u2018date rape\u2019 and other drugs. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times. If you\u2019re in a bar and don\u2019t feel well, try to seek help from people you know. Unscrupulous tour agents have targeted lone young female travellers in the Cusco area.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a victim of crime, try to report it to the police as soon as possible so they can start investigations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests</h3>\n\n<p>Local protests are common and can turn violent quickly. Sometimes they disrupt road, rail, river and air travel and affect tourist areas like Cusco, Arequipa, Puerto Maldonado and Iquitos. Protests in Puno can result in the closure of the border crossing with Bolivia, including Lake Titicaca. Protests in Machu Picchu can result in the suspension of train and bus services to the ruins.</p>\n\n<p>Seek local advice before you set off.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"social-conflicts\">Social conflicts</h3>\n\n<p>Local groups often announce strike action with little or no notice.  These are normally around mining interests and may quickly spill over from one region to another.  These demonstrations can become violent and there is a high potential for roadblocks. You should avoid large gatherings and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.peru.travel/en/\">website of the Peruvian Ministry of Tourism</a> has useful information for tourists and visitors in English, and its local tourist Information and Assistance service - telephone +51 1 574 8000 (24 hours a day) can handle enquiries in English. On <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">the Ministry of Tourism website</a> you will also find information about the government offices that help tourists around the country. The Tourist Protection Network has launched a new 24/7 free line to contact the Tourist Police on 0800 22221. They can handle enquiries in English.</p>\n\n<p>Drugs, organised crime and terrorism are inextricably linked. There is a higher risk to your safety in regions where there is intensive coca cultivation and processing, including the Alto Huallaga, Aguaytia, Apurimac-Ene and Mantaro (VRAEM) river basins. Remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group continue to conduct occasional ambushes and attacks mainly targetting Police, military forces and local authorities. Seek local advice about dangerous areas.</p>\n\n<p>A state of emergency for security reasons is in force in some districts of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Junin, Madre de Dios and Cusco regions (Cusco city, Machu Picchu and Manu Park are not affected) and in the Apurimac-Cusco-Arequipa transportation corridor. For further information you should contact <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">Iperu</a>. A state of emergency gives the armed forces responsibility for law and order alongside the police. Some civil rights are suspended. If you do decide to visit any area under a state of emergency you should follow instructions given to you by military, police or other officials.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"unregulated-tour-services\">Unregulated tour services</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to undertake adventure activities like canopy/zipline, bungee jumping, paragliding, kayaking, rock climbing, etc, please note that the agency providing the service must have a licence for these activities. For more information, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">Ministry of Tourism</a>, as they can provide you with updated information on tour services. You should also check with companies for their health and safety precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n\n<p>Be especially alert to the local security situation in the border areas with Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of increased drug trafficking and other organised crime in the area around the Putumayo river, near the border with Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil. There are also threats of incursions from armed guerilla forces and FARC dissidents at the border with Colombia.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, there is an increase of law enforcement activity</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re crossing the Peru-Ecuador border (by land) you should do so at official checkpoints only. Other parts of the border may still have unexploded landmines.\nYou should exercise extra vigilance in these areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"migration-from-the-north\">Migration from the North</h3>\n\n<p>There has been an increase of migration from the North entering Peru through the land border with Ecuador.  A state of emergency has been declared in the Aguas Verdes and Zarumilla districts (Zarumilla province) and in Tumbes district (Tumbes province) in the Region of Tumbes due to pressure on health and sanitation services following the increased international migration from the North.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"inca-trail\">Inca trail</h3>\n\n<p>To protect the Inca trail, where only guided groups are allowed, there is a government fee and restrictions on numbers. During the high season (June\u2013August) you should make reservations with a travel agency well in advance. Always register when entering national parks and be particularly careful in steep or slippery areas which are unfenced or unmarked. Several climbers have died or suffered serious injuries after falling while climbing Huayna Picchu, a peak near Machu Picchu. Only very basic medical assistance is available at Machu Picchu.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative route to Machu Picchu, also known as \u2018the Inca Jungle Trail\u2019 can be difficult for vehicles due to poor road conditions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lake-titicaca\">Lake Titicaca</h3>\n\n<p>Travel in groups when walking along the banks of Lake Titicaca. There have been incidents of armed robberies against travellers walking on their own.\u00a0Take care at all times and contact the local tourist information centre for advice about known safe zones. Local authorities advise against travelling alone at night in the Desaguadero area on the Peru-Bolivia border at the southern end of Lake Titicaca.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nazca-lines\">Nazca Lines</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to overfly the Nazca Lines, check the airline company is licensed and has a good safety record before you book.  For more information, please contact <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">Iperu</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"spiritual-cleansing\">Spiritual cleansing</h3>\n\n<p>Shamans and other individuals offer \u2018spiritual cleansing\u2019 to tourists in the Amazon area, Northern Peru and Cusco. This service is often referred to as Ayahuasca or San Pedro and typically involves the consumption of  a brew containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an hallucinogenic drug. Consumption of this brew is not regulated and its interaction with existing medical conditions isn\u2019t well understood. People have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death after participating in these ceremonies.  There have also been reports of sexual assault during these ceremonies.  If you have been sexually assaulted or raped in Peru and you wish to seek assistance or to report the incident, you can refer to this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/682686/Rape_and_Sexual_Assault_Victims_Guide.pdf\">guidance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Spiritual cleansing retreats are usually some distance from populated areas making it difficult to access medical attention for those who need it. Some retreats have basic medical services, including first aid, but others don\u2019t. Some don\u2019t even have an established plan for how clients can access medical facilities in case of an emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"amazon-cruise-ships\">Amazon Cruise ships</h3>\n\n<p>In July 2016 a cruise ship carrying foreign nationals was robbed while travelling along the River Amazon.  Security arrangements vary between different cruise operators. For more information about safety and security on Amazon cruise ships, contact your cruise ship operator or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">iPeru (official tourist information and assistance)</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"huaraz-region-of-the-cordillera-blanca-mountains\">Huaraz Region of the Cordillera Blanca Mountains</h3>\n\n<p>Several hikers have died and others have had to be rescued after serious accidents in the Huaraz region of the Cordillera Blanca Mountains, where Peru\u2019s highest peaks are located. Most rescues are carried out on foot because helicopters can\u2019t fly to the areas where hikers are stranded. Contact iperu offices in Huaraz (telephone: +51 (43) 428812) before you set off.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-rafting-and-boating\">River rafting and boating</h3>\n\n<p>Check that the company you use is well established and make sure your insurance covers you for all the activities you want to undertake. The weather can impact on white-water rafting and boating conditions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sand-buggies\">Sand buggies\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>There have been deaths and injuries involving recreational sand buggies, particularly in the sand dunes around Ica and Lake Huacachina. These buggies are unregulated and the drivers and agencies take no responsibility for the welfare of passengers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Peru with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months or with an <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> for up to one year.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re driving on an IDP, from 28 March 2019 you should have the 1968 version of the IDP to drive in Peru. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Carry your passport with you at all times when driving.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care if you are driving close to places where protests are taking place. Don\u2019t attempt to pass blockades.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards in Peru are poor. Stop signs and traffic lights are often ignored. Fatal crashes occur frequently. Drivers don\u2019t always show concern for pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>Bus crashes are common, especially at night. Only use reputable transport companies, and where possible avoid overnight travel, especially in mountainous and remote regions. Always wear a seat belt.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"false-accommodation-websites\">False accommodation websites</h3>\n<p>There have been reports that people searching for accommodation in Lima have been directed to false websites imitating genuine accommodation providers (eg, Airbnb). The false website link is sent to the customer by the fraudster, who then requests a rent payment transfer. If you\u2019re booking through a website, make sure it\u2019s genuine.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorist attacks in Peru can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Don\u2019t take coca leaves or coca tea out of the country.\u00a0It\u2019s illegal to import these items into the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Some British nationals are being targeted for recruitment as drug couriers through email scams, where online fraudsters, through the promise of financial reward, ask people to travel to Peru where they are unexpectedly presented with some items/gifts to take with them out of the country. These items contain drugs and the person carrying them will face detention for drug trafficking.

The vast majority of these animals and products are of illegal origin and could involve protected or endangered species. Their commercialization and export are also illegal or may require special permits when leaving Peru.</p>\n\n<p>The following common products, which are often found for sale in Peru, could be illegal. We recommend avoiding them. At the very least, you should ask about their origins before buying or consuming them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Products made from the skin of felines, deer, bears, snakes, and other animals</li>\n  <li>Crafts made with preserved invertebrates (butterflies, spiders, beetles, starfish, etc) and vertebrates (sea horses and fish)</li>\n  <li>Crafts and jewelry made with wild bird feathers (including condor feathers), turtle shells, teeth, bones, and other animal parts</li>\n  <li>Live monkeys and birds, such as finger monkeys, parakeets, and macaws</li>\n  <li>Dishes made with caiman, paca (wild rodent) or turtle meat, and beverages made with frog.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information, go to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sicompraserescomplice.pe/\">Campaign Against Illegal Wildlife Trafficking</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>The sale of souvenirs made with any animal parts, including condor feathers, is illegal.

You can carry a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place.  You may be asked to show your passport to enter some archaeological sites.  You should check with your tour operator in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is legal in Peru but social attitudes are generally conservative. Crimes against the LGBT community are not included in recently adopted hate crime legislation and same-sex partnerships are not formally recognised.

They are accepted to leave Peru only, issued by the British Embassy in Lima.  After receiving the ETD, the holder will have to approach the Peruvian Immigration Office to get a new entry immigration stamp.  This can be done at the airport.

The letter must mention the proposed destination, the purpose of the trip, the date of departure and the return date.</p>\n\n<p>If unable to obtain a notarial permission, the child will need a judicial written permission (Autorizaci\u00f3n de Viaje Judicial) issued by a judge. If one of the parents has committed certain crimes, the other parent can request a judicial written permission from the judge. If one of the parents is deceased, the other parent would need to submit the death certificate to a notary public, so that an indefinite notarial permit to travel with the child is issued.</p>\n\n<p>Children who have tourist status do not need these permissions, but immigration officers are free to request them in circumstances considered suspicious by the immigration authorities or if the child has stayed in Peru for over 183 days.</p>\n\n<p>For further information, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.consulado.pe/es/londres/Paginas/Inicio.aspx\">Peruvian Consulate in London</a> or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.migraciones.gob.pe/\">Peruvian Immigration Department</a>.</p>\n", "slug": "entry-requirements", "title": "Entry requirements"}, {"body": "<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n<p>Peru is in an active earthquake zone and there are frequent tremors.
