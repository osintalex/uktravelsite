Don\u2019t travel with anyone other than your tour operator. If you need to take a taxi, make sure it\u2019s a registered one and not a private vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Car-related crime and muggings occur from time to time, not only in Havana but also in Santiago de Cuba and other areas. Take care in central Havana at night. Use a taxi rather than walk, even if you\u2019re only a few blocks away from your destination. There have been attacks on foreigners in hire cars after their tyres have been deliberately punctured. If you get a puncture in a remote area, drive on to a town before stopping. Don\u2019t stop for hitch-hikers as they\u2019ve also been known to carry out attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of pickpockets and bag-snatchers, especially in Old Havana, on public transport, at major tourist sites and in nightclubs. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash, avoid wearing expensive jewellery and leave valuables in the hotel safe. Carry a copy of your passport and lock the original away. Beware of thefts from rooms, particularly in private guest houses (\u2018casas particulares\u2019). Hi-tech items like phones and laptops are highly sought after in Cuba and are particularly attractive to thieves</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Visitors can hire cars, but not in Havana, Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus, or Pinar del Rio.  Visitors to Cayo Coco, Cayo Cruz and Cayo Guillermo will only be limited to travel within the Cayos and cannot drive their hire car to another municipality or province.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Cuba using a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months from the date of your entry into the country. Foreign residents, both permanent and temporary, who stay in Cuba for more than 6 months will need to pass a Cuban Driving test so they can get a Cuban Licence and submit a letter from the Embassy involved stating that it is a valid document. If you rent a car make sure the insurance includes local third party cover.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst valid foreign driving licences are generally accepted, it may be advisable to obtain an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP), as 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use after this date.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>All drivers and passengers of motorcycles and scooters are required by law to wear a crash helmet. In view of serious accidents that have involved tourists, you should not use mopeds or three wheel Coco-Taxis for travel around Cuba.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are variable. Many vehicles, including public transport, are badly maintained. Roads are poorly lit and sign-posted. Beware of cyclists, potholes and cars that stop without warning to pick up hitch-hikers. Vehicles that break down are often left on the road until repairs can be made. Avoid driving at night, when animals and unlit vehicles are a real danger.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t drink and drive.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a serious traffic accident the police investigation may take several months to resolve. During this time you will normally not be allowed to leave Cuba and may even be detained. If convicted of killing someone in a road traffic accident, you can expect to receive a very lengthy prison sentence. If you do have a serious accident, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-havana\">British Embassy</a> as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Radio taxis are generally reliable.

This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">International Civil Aviation Organisation</a> carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Cuba.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=CU\">Aviation Safety network</a></p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US and Netherlands authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Cuba is a one-party state.
