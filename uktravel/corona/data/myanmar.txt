Further local preventative measures may also be in effect in regions, townships, wards, and village tracks across Myanmar, including in Yangon. Additional movement restrictions may be imposed in specific townships if COVID-19 cases are found. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports that the main highways out of Yangon have been locked down. Those wishing to enter Yangon must quarantine for 14 days.</p>\n\n<p>All townships in Yangon, except for the Coco Island Region, are  currently under a \u2018Stay at Home\u2019 order. The rules state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in \u2018essential private services\u2019 are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the Government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items. A curfew from 11pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon.</p>\n\n<p>The government of Myanmar currently advises foreign nationals against all but essential travel to Rakhine State, in response to an increased number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the area.

A curfew from 9pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in all townships with reported COVID-19 cases.</p>\n\n<p>Those living in an area under a \u2018Stay at Home\u2019 order should stay in their homes, unless they have permission from the local ward administrator to go outside. Permission to go outside is generally only granted to those who are preforming specific tasks recognised by the government, or for one person per household to go shopping, or for two persons per household to go to a medical hospital or clinic. If you are in an area under a \u2018Stay at Home\u2019 order you should contact the local ward administrators for details, including any requirements that may be specific to that location.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone wishing to travel outside of a township subject to a \u2018Stay at Home\u2019 order will need permission from the local government. Any person travelling from a township placed under a \u2018Stay at Home\u2019 order, to another part of Myanmar may be placed in a government quarantine facility for at least 14 days upon arrival at their destination. This will include testing for COVID-19 for which foreign nationals may be charged.

Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders.</p>\n\n<p>It is recommended that foreigners carry:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>passport</li>\n  <li>Form C (immigration document)</li>\n  <li>Foreigner\u2019s Registration Certificate</li>\n  <li>Myanmar Driver\u2019s Licence (if you own a car)</li>\n  <li>a copy of your passport information page</li>\n  <li>a copy of your Myanmar visa</li>\n  <li>a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n<p>There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign tourists are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. If you are on a tourist visa and are not currently staying in a registered hotel or guest house, you should move into one now. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.</p>\n\n<p>Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-places-and-services\">Public places and services</h2>\n<p>Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may require customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in public places.</p>\n\n<p>The government of Myanmar ordered all schools, including private ones, to close from 26 August. The date for re-opening has not yet been announced.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"myanmar-visa-extensions--renewals-and-uk-passport--uk-visa-applications\">Myanmar visa extensions / renewals and UK passport / UK visa applications</h2>\n\n<p>For those with tourist/social visit visas the Myanmar government has agreed that overstays will be permitted with no legal penalty.  When you leave Myanmar you will be required to pay an overstay fee of US $3 per day of overstay for the first 90 days and a fee of US $5 per day thereafter. This is payable in cash to the Immigration Department at Yangon Airport.</p>\n\n<p>British Nationals usually resident in Myanmar but currently away with expired business visas should apply for a single entry business visa at your nearest Myanmar Embassy (with a sponsorship letter from your employer).  You should then apply for a long term multi-entry visa in Myanmar when you return.</p>\n\n<p>New tourist visa applications are currently suspended.</p>\n\n<p>Applications for UK passports and UK visas are normally processed on Gov.uk with papers submitted at the VFS office at the Hledan Centre in Yangon.

Myanmar\u2019s military retains 25% of seats in parliament as well as various other political offices. The next parliamentary elections have been scheduled for 8 November 2020. Ahead of any election, there may be increased gatherings and rallies. You should avoid all demonstrations and large political gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar has suffered from prolonged internal conflicts, involving a number of non-state armed groups from Myanmar\u2019s border areas. Ten Ethnic Armed Groups and the Government have signed a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement.  Additional armed actors have bilateral ceasefire agreements with the government. However, even where there are ceasefires in place, the possibility of violent clashes remains in some areas of all border states including Shan, Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Karen/Kayin, and Mon. You should review the advice for each state before you visit, and seek advice from a local guide or tour operator where appropriate. There is no formal ceasefire as yet in Kachin State or in northern Shan State\u2019s Kokang Self-Administered Zone.</p>\n\n<p>The political situation remains unsettled outside the central areas. Restrictions on freedom of assembly, movement and the right to form trade unions remain in place following extremely narrow legislative reforms. Restrictions on freedom of speech, movement, religion, and political activity remain, and under current laws criticism of the government can result in imprisonment, detainment and deportation. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, there have been acts of politically motivated violence around public holidays like Armed Forces Day (27 March) and Martyrs Day (19 July). On other anniversaries, like the 8 August 1988 uprising against the government and the September 2007 protests, you can expect to see an increase in security forces in Yangon and elsewhere in Myanmar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of hostility aimed at foreigners since the Coronavirus outbreak began, though not widespread. You should remain alert at all times.</p>\n\n<p>There are no officially issued accurate crime statistics.  Anecdotal evidence suggests occasional instances of violent crime against foreigners. The most common crimes are non-violent crimes of opportunity (pickpocketing, theft of unattended possessions in public places or hotel rooms, bag snatching, gem/confidence scams). At night, it is recommended that visitors explore city sights in groups or with a partner. Thieves often attempt to distract a victim by asking questions, begging for money, selling items, or bumping/jostling. You should take extra care of your belongings and take sensible security precautions at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar is still largely a cash-only society. Travellers, who are often required to carry large sums of local currency, should avoid displaying cash or other valuables in public.\nBeware of merchants offering to sell gems, gold, semi-precious stones. This could result in substantial loss of money and/or a violation of local laws. Do not purchase gems or minerals from an unlicensed source.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"scams\">Scams</h2>\n\n<p>There have been incidents where people have received emails from individuals claiming to work for British firms seeking loans to advance their business interests in Myanmar.

Tourists can visit Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions without restrictions. Other destinations are subject to limitations (eg access by air or train but not by road). For more information, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://tourism.gov.mm/\">Myanmar Ministry of Hotels and Tourism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals with disabilities or access requirements should be prepared to face difficulties throughout Myanmar. Roads and pavements are often difficult to cross. Ramps and accessible facilities are rare.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n\n<p>The Myanmar government restricts travel to most border areas. Be particularly vigilant and take extra care in border areas. Unmarked landmines also pose a threat in many border regions. There is ongoing military activity close to borders with Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos, India and China especially in Rakhine, Chin, Shan and Kachin States. There are occasional clashes in Karen/Kayin State (Myawaddy and Kawkareik) and Mon State (Kyaik Mayaw). You should seek advice from guides or tour operators before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar has closed all land borders with its neighbouring countries to foreigners. Any foreign national with a valid entry visa may only enter and exit Myanmar at Yangon,  Mandalay or Nay Pyi Taw International Airports.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t attempt to cross any border illegally or enter restricted areas without the appropriate permissions from the Myanmar authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rakhine-state\">Rakhine State</h3>\n\n<p>For British Nationals who remain in Myanmar, notwithstanding the dynamic COVID-19 situation, the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to Rakhine State except the southern townships (administrative areas similar to a borough or county) of  Munaung,  Thandwe (including the tourist resort of Ngapali) and Gwa.</p>\n\n<p>Since serious civil unrest in 2012, there have been regular outbreaks of armed conflict between different ethnic groups and the Myanmar military, particularly in northern Rakhine. Current outbreaks of violence are affecting both north and central Rakhine, including the town of Mrauk U and the roads in and out of Sittwe. Conflict between the Arakan Army (AA) and the Myanmar military continues, particularly in northern Rakhine in the townships of Buthiduang, Kyauktaw, Rathaedaung and Ponnagyun, and has spread to the tourist destination of Mrauk U and surrounding villages.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several instances of kidnappings (11 October, 26 October and 5 November 2019), including the abduction of civilians. Holidaymakers have not been targeted. During the incident on 26 October, where a civilian passenger ferry was captured travelling between Sittwe and Buthidaung, civilian casualties were reported during the attempts to reach those taken hostage.</p>\n\n<p>Military bases, vessels and their surrounding areas are frequently targeted. Proximity to military bases and vehicles in conflict areas will increase your risk of being caught up in conflict. The Arakan Army has issued a warning for all civilians not to use military vehicles, boats or helicopters when travelling to conflict areas.</p>\n\n<p>There is a significant military and ethnic armed presence across Northern and Central Rakhine State and the situation is volatile.</p>\n\n<p>Mobile communications in northern and central Rakhine State have been subject to shutdowns, and cannot be relied upon.  There is currently a Government imposed shutdown in 8 townships in Northern Rakhine.</p>\n\n<p>The southern townships of Thandwe (including the holiday resort Ngapali) and Gwa are unaffected by the current fighting in Rakhine. Both remain popular holiday destinations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kachin-state\">Kachin State</h3>\n\n<p>For British Nationals who remain in Myanmar, the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to Kachin State (except the towns of Myitkyina, Bhamo and Putao) due to a continued risk of armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to Myitkyina, Bhamo and Putao, you should monitor local developments and keep in close contact with your tour operator in case the security situation changes. There is a risk of armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The railway track between Mandalay and Myitkyina has been a target, most recently in May 2018. The Myanmar authorities are currently restricting travel between Myitkyina and Bhamo: travel to and between these two towns is permitted by air only.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"shan-state\">Shan State</h3>\n\n<p>For British Nationals who remain in Myanmar, the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to northern Shan State. There has been conflict in northern Shan State between different ethnic armed groups and the Myanmar military for many years, and the situation remains volatile.</p>\n\n<p>On 15 August 2019 there were a series of coordinated attacks at a number of locations, including Pyin Oo Lwin in Mandalay Region, around 65km by road from Mandalay City, and Naung Cho (also spelled Nawnghkio) in northern Shan State. There were reports of a number of casualties, including civilians. The situation in northern Shan State remains volatile.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"chin-state\">Chin State</h3>\n\n<p>There is active conflict in Paletwa township in southern Chin State. For British Nationals who remain in Myanmar, the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to Paletwa township.</p>\n\n<p>On 5 November 2019, a number of civilians (including foreign nationals) were abducted between Paletwa town in Chin State and Kyauktaw town in Rakhine State.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h3>\n<p>As a result of years of conflict, the threat of landmines in rural areas is high, particularly in northern and central Rakhine, northern Shan and Kachin States. There is no reliable land mine mapping source. Some areas with known mines are marked by signage, however this practice is not widespread. Visitors should exercise extreme caution if travelling off main roads in these areas. On 26 November 2019 a foreign tourist was killed by a landmine while travelling off the main road in Northern Shan State in the area around Hsipaw town. A woman accompanying him was also injured in the incident.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">a list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe. A list of recent incidents and accidents is available on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=XY\">Aviation Safety Network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Airlines routinely share flight codes, meaning that airlines sometimes use aircraft from outside their own fleet. Passengers aren\u2019t always advised in advance where this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>Local flight schedules are subject to change without warning. Leave sufficient time in your travel itinerary to accommodate this.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Railway safety standards are significantly below those in the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Overland travel can be hazardous, particularly in the rainy season (May to October). Roads can become impassable and bridges damaged. Travel by road between many areas outside the key destinations of Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions is restricted. Check with your tour operator or the Ministry of Hotels, Tourism and Sport before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Road safety standards are significantly lower than in the UK. Under Myanmar law, the driver of a car involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault. Many vehicles, including taxis and buses, are in a poor mechanical state, and serious road traffic accidents are common. Although driving is on the right in Myanmar, the majority of cars are right hand drive.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid travel where possible on the main Mandalay-Naypyitaw-Yangon road at night, due to bad lighting and poor road surfacing.</p>\n\n<p>Due to COVID-19 the border between India and Myanmar is currently closed. All other land borders are closed to foreigners.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h2>\n\n<p>Seek local advice about where it is safe to swim or dive in the sea. River transport may not meet internationally recognised safety standards and search and rescue facilities may be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Passenger ferries have been subject to attacks in Rakhine State.</p>\n\n<p>During the monsoon season (normally May to October), heavy rains can cause flooding. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before undertaking any river journey. All travellers should avoid wading, swimming or bathing in freshwater to prevent catching schistosomiasis. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/burma/health\">Health</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming-and-scuba-diving\">Swimming and scuba diving</h2>\n\n<p>Exercise caution at beach resorts in Ngwe Saung, Chaung Tha and Ngapali as there are strong underwater currents and riptides. There are no lifeguards and drownings have occurred. Due to Coronavirus, these resorts are currently closed.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering diving excursions in Myanmar, make sure you are happy with the safety measures in place. Rented diving equipment may not meet internationally acceptable safety standards and may not be maintained adequately.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mobile-phones-and-internet\">Mobile phones and Internet</h2>\n\n<p>Myanmar\u2019s technological infrastructure is improving rapidly and foreign visitors and residents can expect to see significant change in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>International GSM roaming is now available in Myanmar and all local networks offer 3G and 4G. If roaming is enabled, some UK SIM cards will work and coverage is fairly reliable in the main cities. UK mobile service providers may charge especially high prices for roaming in Myanmar.</p>\n\n<p>Many visitors travel with a spare mobile phone and buy a SIM card when they arrive (approximately 1500 Kyat \u2013 about \u00a31). This can then be topped up as needed.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Myanmar.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Pre-trial detention can also last many months.</p>\n\n<p>The legal process in Myanmar is unpredictable, lacks transparency and is open to interference from powerful political and business interests. The investigation and trial process falls far below the standard expected in the UK. British nationals in Myanmar should be aware that there are limits to the assistance the British Embassy can offer to those with concerns about the fairness of their trial as we are unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country.</p>\n\n<p>The conditions in Myanmar prisons are extremely poor and overcrowded. Medical facilities in prisons are also extremely poor. The UK has no prisoner transfer agreement with Myanmar, so if you\u2019re found guilty you can expect to serve your full prison term in Myanmar, have your visa revoked and be deported when released.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual abuse against children is a serious crime. The UK and Myanmar authorities are committed to combating travelling child sex offenders. Those who commit sex offences against children abroad can also be prosecuted in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for drug trafficking range from a minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and can include the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar\u2019s defamation laws give broad scope for individuals to bring potentially arbitrary charges which could result in criminal penalties, including a prison sentence. Foreigners have been subject to criminal investigations for acts such as posting a critical review of a hotel online.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-customs\">Religious customs</h3>\n\n<p>Respect religious customs when visiting Buddhist religious sites. Shorts and sleeveless tops will cause offence. You should remove shoes and socks before entering a pagoda or monastery. The Myanmar government and Myanmar Tourist Federation have <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dosanddontsfortourists.com/index.html\">published tips for visitors on local customs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Under Myanmar law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offence. Insulting religion is a broad term, and can include any disrespectful depiction or image (including tattoos) of Buddha or other religious representation, or wearing any tattoo of Buddha anywhere below the waist.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently measures in place for visiting religious sights to prevent the spread of coronavirus. You should check the local rules and regulations before entering.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography-and-drones\">Photography and drones</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t take photographs or videos of the police, any demonstrations, military installations or military personnel.</p>\n\n<p>Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior government permission and flying them in sensitive areas such as government buildings, famous tourist sites, and religious buildings can result in criminal penalties, including jail time and the permanent confiscation of the drone.  As it is rarely clear what constitutes a sensitive area, all recreational use of drones is inadvisable.  If you wish to bring a drone to Myanmar, you\u2019re strongly advised to seek official permission from the Myanmar government.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"endangered-species\">Endangered species</h3>\n\n<p>Myanmar is a party to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cites.org/\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)</a>. Over 800 species of animals and plants are banned from international trade and a further 30,000 are strictly controlled by CITES and EU legislation. You should consider the restrictions on the export of endangered species under CITES when deciding whether to buy exotic souvenirs, including those made from turtles.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is technically illegal in Myanmar, although these laws are rarely enforced in practice. These laws can carry punishments of up to life imprisonment and apply equally to men and women. There have been reports of police using threats of prosecution to extort bribes and allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention, although these have primarily been reported by Myanmar nationals.</p>\n\n<p>LGBT people are rarely open about their sexuality or gender identity publicly, and LGBT communities are more likely tolerated than accepted within Myanmar society.

During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test.</li>\n  <li>Provide evidence of a negative COVID test result.</li>\n  <li>Complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival).</li>\n  <li>Undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will be required to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period.
