In January 2018 a hot air balloon crash killed one person and injured 12 others in Luxor. Some UK tour operators have not been able to verify independently safety procedures for balloon flights and are not selling balloon flights to their customers. Speak to your tour company before booking a balloon flight.</p>\n\n<p>If you are considering diving or snorkelling in any of the Red Sea resorts be aware that safety standards of diving operators can vary considerably. Never dive or snorkel unaccompanied. Where possible make bookings through your tour representative. Very cheap operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards. Diving beyond the depth limit of your insurance policy will invalidate your cover.</p>\n\n<p>Shark attacks of any kind are very unusual in the Red Sea. There were a series of attacks in Sharm el Sheikh in late 2010 and in March 2015, a German tourist was killed by a shark attack in al-Qusair. You should monitor updates issued by the local authorities and your tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several serious quad bike accidents involving British nationals in resort areas. Take the same precautions as you would in the UK and note that safety standards can vary considerably. Always wear a crash helmet.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>There remains a small risk from unexploded landmines in certain desert areas in the north west of Egypt near to Alamein, and on some limited stretches of the Mediterranean coast near Marsa Matrouh and on the Red Sea coast south of Suez.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Egyptian security forces, religious sites, large public gatherings and places visited by foreigners. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas), when terrorist groups have sometimes called for attacks. Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. Terrorists have attacked tourists in Egypt in the past. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks targeting Coptic Christians from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai in Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>You should follow the advice of Egyptian authorities, remaining particularly vigilant and maintaining a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings. You can find a list of holidays on the <a href=\"/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-cairo/office/british-embassy-cairo-main-contact\">British Embassy Cairo website</a>.

Several others were wounded in the attack</li>\n  <li>on 2 November 2018, gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians in Minya province, upper Egypt, killing 7 people. Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"north-sinai\">North Sinai</h3>\n<p>There are frequent reports of terrorist attacks in North Sinai. Most attacks are in the northeast corner of the governorate between Al-Arish city and the border with Gaza, but the whole of the North Sinai governorate is at risk. A state of emergency in North Sinai is in effect and a curfew is in place.</p>\n\n<p>Most attacks in North Sinai are against the Egyptian government and military installations and personnel; however attacks have been carried out against civilians suspected of working with the authorities and local religious minority groups.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-groups-in-egypt\">Terrorist groups in Egypt</h3>\n<p>Daesh-Sinai is the most active terrorist group in Egypt. Most Daesh-Sinai attacks have targeted government, security forces and Coptic Christians, but foreigners have also been targeted. Their main area of operations is North Sinai, but the group has claimed responsibility for attacks in other areas including South Sinai, Cairo, the western desert and Nile delta cities.</p>\n\n<p>Al Qaeda aligned groups also maintain a presence in Egypt and in 2017 Ansar al-Islam claimed an attack against Egyptian security forces in the Bahariya Oasis in Egypt\u2019s Western Desert.</p>\n\n<p>Muslim Brotherhood-aligned groups have also undertaken attacks on security forces.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation and maritime</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"aviation\">Aviation</h3>\n<p>Terrorists in Egypt likely maintain the intent and capability to target aviation.</p>\n\n<p>The greatest threat is on the North Sinai Peninsula where Daesh operate with greater freedom, but terrorists are active throughout Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports and observe any additional security measures.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"maritime\">Maritime</h3>\n<p>There is also a threat of maritime terrorism.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers.

Most visits are trouble free.</p>\n\n<p>Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/egypt/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt. There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Although most attacks occur in North Sinai, there is a risk of terrorist attacks across the country. Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Egyptian security forces, religious sites, large public gatherings and places visited by foreigners. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas), when terrorist groups have sometimes called for attacks. Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. Terrorists have attacked tourists in Egypt in the past. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks targeting Coptic Christians from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai in Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>You should follow the advice of Egyptian authorities, remaining particularly vigilant and maintaining a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings. You can find a list of public holidays on the <a href=\"/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-cairo/office/british-embassy-cairo-main-contact\">British Embassy Cairo website</a>. The authorities in Egypt maintain a significant security presence across the country, including armed security officers stationed at important sites, critical infrastructure, and road checkpoints. Extra measures are in place at tourist sites. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/egypt/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Following the crash of a St Petersburg-bound flight in North Sinai in October 2015, direct flights between the UK and Sharm el Sheikh were suspended. The UK government has worked with Egyptian authorities to enable flights to resume, and on 22 October 2019 the <a href=\"/government/news/government-lifts-restrictions-on-flights-to-sharm-el-sheikh\">restrictions were lifted</a>. You should check with your airline or tour operator for information on services.</p>\n\n<p>There remains a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation in Egypt. Additional security measures are in place for flights departing from Egypt to the UK. You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports.
