In recent years, there have been instances of civil and political unrest.  You should avoid any protests, political gatherings, demonstrations or marches.</p>\n\n<p>L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 (criticism of the monarchy in any form) is a crime, which can be interpreted broadly and carries a long jail sentence. Some foreign (including British) and Thai journalists, Human Rights Defenders and members of the public have faced criminal charges, including for defamation, sedition, and under the Computer Crimes Act for raising concerns, making political comments, and sharing articles online that could been seen as portraying Thailand negatively or making accusations about individuals.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re the victim of a crime in Thailand and wish to report it to the Thai police you should do so before leaving the country. If you do not, your case may not be investigated. Be aware that the way the media report crime is different from the UK. Local authorities, including the police, may give detailed press briefings. There have been instances where the victims of crime have been identified and threatened with prosecution by the police for damaging Thailand\u2019s reputation.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that posting images on social media of people drinking alcohol or wearing inappropriate clothing can result in fines and/or imprisonment both for the person who uploaded the images and the people in them.</p>\n\n<p>Be on your guard against pickpockets and bag snatchers, especially from thieves on motorbikes or when travelling in open transport like tuk tuks. Make sure valuables are kept securely and out of sight. Passengers on buses and trains have had items taken from bags while asleep.</p>\n\n<p>Violent crime, including gun crime, rarely involves foreign tourists, although in 2018 several foreign nationals were victims of gun violence in Bangkok. You should take care when travelling in unfamiliar areas and avoid walking through less travelled areas alone, especially at night.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t hand over your passport to third parties as a guarantee (eg to motorcycle or jet ski rental businesses) as companies may hold on to passports against claimed damage.</p>\n\n<p>Violent sexual assaults and unprovoked attacks have been reported in tourist destinations across Thailand. These are particularly common during Full Moon parties and other similar events and late at night near bars.</p>\n\n<p>Drink spiking and date rapes have been reported in tourist destinations around Thailand, with both male and female victims. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended, particularly in Koh Tao, Koh Samui, Pattaya and at the Full Moon party on Koh Phangan.</p>\n\n<p>Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment resulting in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Some British nationals in Thailand have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, resulting in some suicides.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of the possibility of credit card fraud. Don\u2019t lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming in Thailand. Where possible use an ATM within a bank and always protect your PIN.</p>\n\n<p>Buying a property in Thailand isn\u2019t straightforward and you should be aware of the risks before making any financial commitments. British people have been caught up in property scams. Several face criminal defamation charges for alleging fraud and malpractice in response to being scammed. The legal process can be lengthy and expensive.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation, unless you qualify for an exemption under the Emergency Decree you should not attempt to cross land borders at present. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"myanmar-border\">Myanmar border</h3>\n<p>There are occasional clashes between the Thai security forces, armed criminal groups and drug traffickers along the Thai/Myanmar border. Outside the main towns, police and military checkpoints are actively manned and travelers may be asked to produce ID.  See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.tourismthailand.org/\">Tourism Thailand website</a> and seek advice locally before you travel to this part of the country.</p>\n\n<p>Only cross into <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar\">Myanmar</a> at an official border checkpoint, and after obtaining any relevant permissions/visas from the Burmese and Thai authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cambodian-border\">Cambodian border</h3>\n<p>The line of the international border near the Preah Vihear temple was disputed by Cambodia and Thailand. The exact border is still being agreed.</p>\n\n<p>You should take extra care in border areas and follow the instructions of the local authorities. There are unexploded landmines in the border area, you should stay on marked paths especially around Ta Krabey.</p>\n\n<p>Remain alert to the local situation when travelling anywhere near to the border with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cambodia\">Cambodia</a>, and at land crossings between the two countries.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"laos-border\">Laos border</h3>\n<p>Not all land border crossings into <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/laos\">Laos</a> are open to foreigners and you may need to get a Laos visa before you arrive to cross the border. Much of the exact border is still being agreed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>Due to the  coronavirus situation internal and international air travel options remain more limited than previously. If you intend to leave Thailand and need to take a domestic flight to reach your international airport you should check with your provider and plan carefully as travel between provinces is still subject to some limitations. There are two airports in Bangkok: Suvarnabhumi International Airport and Don Mueang Airport.</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally airports (especially in the north of Thailand) can close in March and April caused by poor air quality affecting visibility. You should check with your airline before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>The FCDO can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>There are a high number of road traffic accidents in Thailand especially involving motorcycles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) rates Thailand as the world\u2019s deadliest country for fatalities on motorcycles, citing an average of 5,500  motorcyclist deaths annually.</p>\n\n<p>To drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand, under Thai law you must have the correct licence and appropriate insurance for the category of vehicle you\u2019re using. You will need to apply for a Thai driving licence or, if you already hold a UK licence, an <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. If you drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand without a valid licence, this may invalidate your travel insurance if you have an accident or injury.</p>\n\n<p>Under Thai law, you must wear a helmet when riding motorcycles.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of accidents involving overnight coach travel. Seek local advice if you are in any doubt about the safety of your transport provider.</p>\n\n<p>Motorcycles or scooters for hire in beach resorts are often unregistered and can\u2019t be used legally on a public road. Before you hire a vehicle, make sure you\u2019re covered by your travel insurance and check the small print of the lease agreement. Don\u2019t hand over your passport as a guarantee against returning a motorcycle or scooter.</p>\n\n<p>Riding quad-bikes can be dangerous. It is also illegal to drive these on the roads even though they\u2019re available to hire on the roadside.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Due to the coronavirus situation rail travel options may be more limited than previously. If you intend to leave Thailand and need to travel by train to reach your airport you should check with your provider.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of train derailments in Thailand. Some have resulted in deaths and injuries.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>Due to the coronavirus situation sea travel options may be more limited than previously.  If you intend to leave Thailand and need to use a boat service to reach your airport you should check with your provider.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous passenger boat services operating between the mainland and islands. There have been some sinkings and collisions which have resulted in fatalities, including British nationals. These incidents are usually due to overloading and/or poor maintenance, but also due to rough seas, particularly during local monsoon season.</p>\n\n<p>During the Full Moon parties, speedboats to and from Koh Phangan are often overloaded. Take care at all times and avoid travelling by sea when conditions are rough or on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adventurous-activities-and-swimming\">Adventurous activities and swimming</h2>\n\n<p>Check that your insurance covers you for any activities.</p>\n\n<p>Extreme sports, including bungee jumping can be dangerous. Make sure the company is using the most up-to-date equipment and safety features, and that they are fully licensed and insured.</p>\n\n<p>When jungle trekking use a reliable, licensed tour guide. Elephant treks and rides can be dangerous, especially when the elephants are mistreated or not handled properly. Foreign tourists, including British nationals, have been killed and seriously injured when handlers have lost control of their elephants.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care when swimming off coastal areas, especially during monsoon season. Strong riptides have drowned people in several areas including Phuket, Koh Chang, Hua Hin, Cha-am, Rayong, Pattaya and the Koh Samui archipelago. Always comply with warning signs, especially red flags, and only swim from approved beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Jellyfish can swim close to the shore, particularly during the rainy season. Their sting can be fatal. If in doubt take local advice from hotel management and dive centres.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming, diving, kayaking or white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls, particularly in the rainy season. Currents can be extremely strong.</p>\n\n<p>The standards maintained by diving schools and rescue services are not always as high as in the UK. Check a dive operator\u2019s credentials carefully before using them and make sure you\u2019re covered by your insurance. If you\u2019ve had no previous diving experience ask your dive operator to explain what cover they offer before signing up for a course. Make sure safety equipment is available on the boat, particularly oxygen.</p>\n\n<p>You should also ask about contingency plans which should include the ability to call for help while at sea and to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber if necessary.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travellers-with-limited-mobility\">Travellers with limited mobility</h2>\n<p>There are many interesting places in Thailand that are accessible to all people. But wheelchair access is often limited due to uneven paving, street furniture and a lack of lifts, ramps, etc. This includes buses, public transit systems, and many taxis have limited storage space for wheelchairs.

You should take care, particularly in public places, follow the advice of the local authorities and monitor local media reports. The Thai authorities have on a number of occasions warned of the possibility of attacks to coincide with symbolic dates or holidays.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, there have been attacks in Bangkok and other parts of the country:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 2 August 2019, coinciding with the ASEAN Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting, a number of small explosions occurred in Bangkok.</li>\n  <li>On 10 March 2019, a number of small explosions occurred in Satun City and in Patthalung Province in the south of Thailand.</li>\n  <li>In December 2018, there were a series of small explosions on Samila beach in Songkhla City.</li>\n  <li>In April and May 2017, there were several explosions in Bangkok.</li>\n  <li>In August 2016, there were multiple explosions and incidents in tourist areas across Thailand (including Hua Hin, Trang, Krabi, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Patong and Loma in Phuket, Surat Thani, and Khao Lak in Phang Nga) involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and incendiary devices.</li>\n  <li>A large bomb exploded at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok in 2015, resulting in numerous casualties, including the death of a British national.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In October 2016, the Thai authorities say they disrupted planned attacks in Bangkok.</p>\n\n<p>The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to Thailand\u2019s southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, and to southern Songkhla province. There are regular attacks in these areas. On 5 November 2019, an attack against a security checkpoint in Yala province resulted in 15 deaths. Methods of attack can include arson, bombings and shootings. Targets have included civilians and members of the security forces, government offices, tourist hotels, discos, bars, shops, marketplaces, supermarkets, schools, transport infrastructure and trains. Over 7,700 people, including civilians, have been killed and several thousand more injured since 2004.</p>\n\n<p>Martial law has been in place in nearly all areas within these provinces since 2006. The security authorities can detain suspects without charge, censor the media, conduct searches and seize documents.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.

Possession of even very small quantities can lead to imprisonment. If you are found guilty of possession of marijuana you could receive a long prison sentence and/or a heavy fine. If you\u2019re found guilty of being in possession of 20 grams of a Class A drug on exiting Thailand you risk receiving the death penalty.  Amphetamines and ecstasy are regarded as Class A drugs and possession or trafficking carries the same penalty as heroin.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking\">Smoking</h3>\n<p>It is illegal to import more than 200 cigarettes per person into Thailand. This is enforced at customs on arrival. Those who exceed the limit may be fined ten times the value of the items and face confiscation of the cigarettes.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2018, Thai authorities introduced a smoking ban on some beaches, including in Koh Samui, Pattaya and in Phuket, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chon Buri and Songkhla provinces. Those caught smoking in non-designated areas face a 100,000 baht fine or up to a year in prison. There are also strict rules on the disposal of all forms of waste, especially polystyrene and plastic, and any act that can cause damage to coastal areas. You should follow local guidance.</p>\n\n<p>On 27 March 2020 the Thai Department of Disease Control linked the smoking of cigarettes to the impact of coronavirus. Smoking in public could result in a fine of up to 5,000 Baht. This includes electronic cigarettes which are illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment. Electronic cigarettes are already illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Vaporisers (like e-cigarettes and e-baraku) and refills are illegal in Thailand. These items may be confiscated and you could be fined or sent to prison for up to 10 years if convicted. Their sale or supply is also banned and you could face a heavy fine or up to 5 years imprisonment if found guilty.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT</h3>\n<p>Thailand is generally a tolerant and progressive place for LGBT travellers, although in parts of Thai society LGBT rights and issues are more tolerated than accepted. There are active LGBT communities and social venues and increasingly people from the LGBT community play high profile roles in the public sphere, including trans-MPs.</p>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are not criminalised by law. Thailand has no legislation on same-sex marriage and same-sex marriages conducted elsewhere aren\u2019t recognised. Those wishing to change their gender marker on official documents can do so from male to female or vice versa, provided that they have undergone, or attempted to undergo, gender reassignment surgery. Thailand does not recognise a third gender. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife\">Wildlife</h3>\n<p>Thailand is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence and the ivory trade is banned.</p>\n", "slug": "local-laws-and-customs", "title": "Local laws and customs"}, {"body": "\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p><strong>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Thailand on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/221/thailand#COVID-19\">TravelHealthPro website</a></p>\n\n<p>See the healthcare information in the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/coronavirus\">Coronavirus section</a> for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Thailand.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest health advice on travelling to Thailand from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/\">TravelHealthPro</a> website.

This issue may continue for several months.</p>\n\n<p>Thailand\u2019s Metropolitan Waterworks Authority advise that there is no risk to public health from drinking tap water but salty water can affect people in higher risk groups, such as those with kidney disease. If you are concerned about the risks to your personal health, you should drink bottled water and/or get medical advice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-quality\">Air quality</h3>\n<p>High levels of air pollution can occur in major urban areas, including in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, which is also affected by regional smoke haze. The high pollution and PM 2.5 counts, occasionally enter the unhealthy and hazardous levels. This may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check air quality levels for many cities in real time on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aqicn.org/city/bangkok\">World Air Quality Index website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>During March and April there is often smoke haze and resulting poor air quality and pollution across parts of the north, north-east and south of Thailand, this can also close regional airports due to visibility. Keep up-to-date with local information and seek medical advice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h3>\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 1669 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Medications which are only available on prescription in the UK like Viagra, Cialis and Valium are readily available in popular nightlife districts across Thailand.
