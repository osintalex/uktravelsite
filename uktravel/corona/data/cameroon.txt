Avoid walking around at night, particularly alone.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant in public places. Trouble can flare up unexpectedly (e.g. at football matches). Make sure car doors are locked when driving around. Avoid wearing jewellery and only carry small amounts of cash and valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Close and lock all doors and windows, particularly at night. Make sure burglar proof metal bars are installed. Identify callers through spy holes before opening doors, especially late at night.</p>\n\n<p>Petty theft is common on trains, coaches and bush taxis and around bus stations and hotels. Taxis in cities operate like buses, picking up passengers while there is still room in the car. They often take indirect routes and many don\u2019t meet basic safety requirements. There have been reports of violent assaults and robberies on taxi passengers. Only use trusted taxis and preferably book one from your hotel or restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>Car-jackings, kidnappings and armed robberies have occurred along roads close to the borders with Central African Republic (CAR), Chad and Nigeria, and along the Bamenda-Banyo, Bafoussam-Banyo, Bafoussam-Doula and Yaound\u00e9-Garoua Boulai-Ngaoundere roads. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon.</p>\n\n<p>Criminality by large gangs and hostage taking for ransom are also a threat more widely in Adamawa region. In January 2017, an armed group attacked a UN border monitoring team near the Nigerian border killing five people.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of kidnapping and hostage taking in the Far North, North, Adamawa, East, North West and South West regions of Cameroon over the past year. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors and residents are often targets of scam artists. The scams come in many forms, and can cause significant financial loss. Scammers also target individuals and companies in the UK via websites, chat-rooms and by email. Advance fee scams are common in Cameroon. Cases involving the alleged adoption of children have been reported. Be very cautious about sending money or travelling to Cameroon to adopt a child where the information has come from a website or through emails. Cameroon does not have adoption agencies. Many victims are persuaded to pay large amounts of money before they suspect anything.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to contact the Police, call 117. If you have been a victim of fraud from a police official, you should call 1500. If you need to contact the fire service, please call 118.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>There is an increased risk of displacement of Nigeria-based extremists into the Far North region following the declarations of a state of emergency in Nigeria\u2019s Borno and Adamawa states. An increased presence of Nigerian extremists in Far North region had already been observed before the declaration, and there is also a general threat of kidnapping and armed banditry. If you\u2019re in the Far North region, you should leave.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a risk of displacement of Nigeria-based extremists into Cameroon\u2019s North and Adamawa regions which border Nigeria\u2019s Adamawa state. There has been an increased number of kidnappings in Cameroon\u2019s Adamawa region across 2018. The ability of the High Commission to offer consular services in the Far North, North and Adamawa regions is limited.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to within 40 km of the border with Chad because of armed banditry, including poachers in Bouba Ndjida National Park in the North region.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to within 40 km of the border with the Central African Republic (CAR). There have been incursions by armed men from CAR and there have been fatalities. Armed banditry and kidnapping remains a risk. Numerous kidnappings have occurred in the period March to July 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Take great care if you travel to the northern regions of Cameroon by road. The eastern route via Garoua-Boulai and Meiganga involves driving close to the border with CAR. The western route requires travel along the Bamenda-Banyo axis. The central route via Yoko requires travel on very poorly maintained roads through largely uninhabited areas, crossing a number of bridges in a poor state of repair. There is no fuel available on the route. If you must attempt this drive, carry plenty of water, sufficient fuel to enable you to turn back if necessary, a spare tyre and a satellite phone or VHF radio to summon assistance if required.</p>\n\n<p>On 9 March the Cameroonian authorities announced travel restrictions on the road linking Bamenda (North West region) and Bafoussam (West region). Vehicles are only permitted to travel at set times in the morning and evening, and must be accompanied by government escorts.  You should monitor information from the local authorities before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>On 6 March authorities in Gabon announced that the land border with Cameroon would be closed indefinitely.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"north-west-and-south-west-anglophone-regions\">North West and South West (Anglophone) regions</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to the North West and South West regions, except Limbe in Fako division, where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain vigilant of separatist groups trying to implement a ban on travel into or out of the North West and South West regions after 1 April 2020. They may also take action to enforce the following within the two regions: forbidding travel by bus and taxi and restricting motorbike passengers to one; requiring the wearing of a mask outside; forbidding gatherings of more than 20 people and social distancing of at least two metres, and requiring personal protective equipment at restricted gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>On 1 December 2019, a local commercial air carrier (Camair Co) was hit by gunshots while flying into Bamenda Airport in the North West region. You should follow the advice of the local security authorities and/or your tour operator if you are thinking about using Camair Co.</p>\n\n<p>General strikes (or \u2018ghost towns\u2019) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including February, May and October. Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days. You should be vigilant, monitor local media and avoid travelling within the region on such days.</p>\n\n<p>Armed separatists imposed lockdowns in May, August and September 2019. During a lockdown in February 2019, there were reports of violence and loss of life. Urban transport in towns and cities was affected and vehicular traffic in and out of the region was restricted. Incidents of sporadic gunfire also occurred, including shooting in Bamenda, Buea and the outskirts of Limbe.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been multiple clashes between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups over the past year in many places in the North West and South West regions. In the first four months of 2019, clashes between the army and armed separatists were reported in the towns of Bafut, Tubah, Ndu, Widikum, Muyuka and in Lebialem, Momo, Bui and Mezam divisions. Restrictions including night curfews and a ban on public meetings, which were imposed following violent and deadly clashes in 2017, remain in place. There is a high risk of violent criminality, especially at night.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Anglophone regions where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy is a threat in the Gulf of Guinea and particularly in the waters around the Niger Delta and the Bakassi Peninsula. Cameroon\u2019s Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR) patrol the waters. The ferry that operates between Limbe/Tiko in Cameroon and Calabar in Nigeria passes through areas where pirates operate. The Bakassi Peninsula is made up of mangrove forests and isolated islands that are difficult to police. Mariners should seek professional security advice and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to Ndian division in the South West. Armed groups operate in this area. Clashes between the army and armed separatists have led to casualties. There is a high threat of kidnapping in Ndian division. The Korup National Park falls inside the area to which the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel.</p>\n\n<p>In November 2018, groups of students were kidnapped in Bamenda and Kumba and released after a few days. In October 2018, there were reports of deaths in some towns and villages in the Anglophone regions, as a result of clashes between separatists and government security forces. A police station was attacked in Mile Four (Bonadikombo), Limbe in September 2018. A security checkpoint was attacked at Mutengene (Tiko) along the road to Limbe in June 2018. Armed men violence on workers of some of the rubber and banana plantations along the main road between Mungo and Tiko has led to abandonment of farms. Other clashes have occurred in Bolifamba (Mile 16), Tole and Muea in Buea. An American missionary was killed near Bamenda in October 2018. A Tunisian road technician was killed in a rescue operation in March 2018 in the South West. In June 2018, armed Anglophone separatist groups erected barricades on several spots along the Buea \u2013 Muyuka \u2013 Kumba road in the South West Region for several days. Travelers were stranded. There were clashes with the army as a result, with casualties. Spontaneous roadblocks and separatist checkpoints recur within the two regions. Kidnapping for ransom is common.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lake-nyos\">Lake Nyos</h3>\n<p>Lake Nyos in the North West Region emitted carbon dioxide suffocating about 1,700 people in 1986. There were no warning signs that this would happen and it could happen again at any time. There is also a concern that the wall of the dam holding back Lake Nyos is not sufficiently strong. Nearby Lake Mounoun is also saturated with carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>There are occasional isolated incidents of political unrest around the country. Be vigilant at all times, and avoid political demonstrations and rallies.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 January 2019, the opposition MRC party held protests in Yaound\u00e9, Douala, Bafoussam and other towns in the West Region. Police fired rubber bullets and used tear gas to disperse protesters. Six people were injured and several arrested. You should remain vigilant, avoid large gatherings and monitor local media.</p>\n\n<p>Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>Several improvised explosive devices were detonated in Yaound\u00e9 in June, July and August 2020. It is possible that similar, or more ambitious, attacks will again occur in urban areas, or other locations around the country, in the future. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Avoid all travel by road at night in rural areas, particularly on the Yaound\u00e9-Douala trunk road, where accidents are common. Plan your journey carefully and travel in convoy, where possible. As mobile phone coverage is limited you should consider taking a VHF radio or satellite phone.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence or <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> on first arrival, but you should obtain a Cameroonian licence from the Delegation of Transport as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure any car you hire is adequately insured, preferably by written confirmation from the insurance company (rather than the car hire firm). If you are hiring a driver and car, make sure you are not liable for any accident or\u00a0damage.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the major routes, roads in Cameroon are generally in poor condition. Many are badly pot-holed. Street lighting, where it exists, is poor. Pedestrians and stray animals on roads are a hazard. Many vehicles are poorly lit and badly driven.</p>\n\n<p>Roadblocks set up by the police or gendarmerie, are common throughout Cameroon. You may be asked to show your passport, driving licence or vehicle registration documents. There are regular reports of uniformed members of the security forces stopping motorists on the pretext of minor or non-existent violations of local vehicle regulations in order to extort small bribes. Don\u2019t pay bribes; ask the officer to provide a ticket, setting out the alleged offence so that you can pay at a local court.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>There is only one local airline operating between a few of the major cities, Camair-co. Scheduled flights are subject to frequent delays and cancellations. Several international  airlines fly into Cameroon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n<p>There is a railway from Douala-Yaound\u00e9-Ngaoundere. On 21 October 2016, a train leaving Yaound\u00e9 en route to Douala derailed at Eseka (120km from Yaound\u00e9 and 160km from Douala). Official sources in Cameroon confirmed the death of at least 80 people with over 500 injured. Passenger travel between Yaound\u00e9 and Douala has been suspended following the train derailment. Travel between Ngaoundere and Yaound\u00e9 by train is still possible.</p>\n\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon, particularly in the Far North region.

Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days. If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Anglophone regions where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements.

You should enhance your vigilance and plan your movements carefully if in major towns throughout Cameroon during this period.</p>\n\n<p>Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship. The terrorist group Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) is active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere, potentially including major towns and cities such as Yaound\u00e9 and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2015, which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region, although since 2017 these have been predominately adjacent to the border with Nigeria. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been hostages taken and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamawa region (Cameroon). See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria.\nBoko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon\u2019s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security#crime\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling at night across Cameroon unless absolutely necessary, due to risks from criminality, poor infrastructure and erratic driving.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Cameroon as having a risk of Zika virus transmission.
