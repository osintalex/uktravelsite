Unfortunately each year there are incidents with visitors getting into difficulty and needing the help of the emergency services.</p>\n\n<p>If you are taking part in extreme sports, check that the company is well established in the industry and that you have arranged for your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel insurance</a> to cover the specific activity. For sports activities like skiing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (for example off-piste skiing), your insurance should include mountain rescue services, helicopter costs and repatriation to your country of residence or possible transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you\u2019re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario. A map, compass, GPS and telecommunication equipment should always be used. Don\u2019t undertake any activity alone, and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.</p>\n\n<p>The following alpine hazards exist throughout the year:</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tavalanches and snow drifts</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tlandslides and flooding</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tglacial crevasses and hollows</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\trockfall</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tthunder storms and lightning</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\taltitude sickness</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tsun exposure</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tsudden weather changes</p>\n\n<p>To check the latest avalanche risk, visit the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.avalanches.org/\">European Avalanche Warning Services</a>.  Observe all warnings about avalanches and where appropriate consider carrying search equipment. Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. You should carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. You should follow all safety instructions carefully given the danger of avalanches in some areas and particularly during times of heavy snow. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used provide the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim.</p>\n\n<p>For more information and advice on enjoying outdoor activities safely and responsibly, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://tourismus.li/en/activities/winter-in-liechtenstein/\">official tourism website of the Principality of Liechtenstein</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about how to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes\">stay safe on the slopes</a>.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Liechtenstein, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.
