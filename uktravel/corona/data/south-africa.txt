It is not yet clear what restrictions will be in place at the time of the tour.  If you\u2019re considering travel to South Africa for the Lions tour, you should make sure that you have appropriate insurance before booking flights, accommodation or tickets.  Follow <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa\">Travel Advice</a> for the latest information regarding travelling to South Africa.</p>\n", "slug": "coronavirus", "title": "Coronavirus"}, {"body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Call the police (on 10111 or on 112 from a mobile phone) at the first sign of danger. Mobile phone reception is generally good in major towns and cities but can be intermittent in more remote spots.</p>\n\n<p>Crime increases in areas where large crowds gather, so be particularly vigilant if you\u2019re attending sporting or other events that attract large numbers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n<p>South Africa has a high level of crime, including rape and murder. The risk of violent crime to visitors travelling to the main tourist destinations is generally low. The South African authorities prioritise protecting tourists and tourism police are deployed in several towns and cities. The most violent crimes tend to occur in townships on the outskirts of major cities and isolated areas \u2013 you should consult a reliable tour guide if you visit a township.</p>\n\n<p>Central business districts (CBDs) of major cities have a greater threat of crime (including armed robbery) than suburban areas, and the threat increases after dark. If you\u2019re visiting the CBD of any major city, remain alert at all times, do not leave valuables on show, and take safe and reliable transport to and from your destination.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiking\">Hiking</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re hiking in National Parks, try to hike in groups and stick to popular trails on popular days (e.g. weekends). There have been violent attacks on hikers and tourists on Table Mountain National Park. Take care in quieter areas of the Park, especially early in the morning or just before the park closes. Cape Town residents use social media (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdoor-Cape-Town/\">Meet up</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/hikecapetown/\">Facebook</a>) to coordinate hikes in larger groups.  More advice on hiking on Table Mountain is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/default.php?id=57375\">South African Nationals Parks</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid isolated beaches and picnic spots. Don\u2019t walk alone, especially in remote areas or on beaches after dark or when beachgoers have left.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fraud-and-scams\">Fraud and scams</h3>\n<p>There is a high incidence of credit card fraud, fraud involving ATMs and \u2018card skimming\u2019. Make sure you hide your PIN when withdrawing money from an ATM or making a transaction in a shop. Refuse offers of help from bystanders. Don\u2019t change large sums of money in busy public areas. Try to use ATMs in banks or secure shopping malls and be discreet when making withdrawals.</p>\n\n<p>Protect any documents containing details of credit cards or bank accounts and do not give personal or financial account information details to anyone. There are organised crime gangs operating in South Africa, who may target visitors and charities.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists. The scams come in many forms including romance and friendship, business ventures and work or employment opportunities. Scams can pose great financial risk to victims. The British High Commission and Consulate General will never contact members of the public regarding personal financial matters including on behalf of any UK banks or other financial institutions. You should to report these calls to the police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</h3>\n<p>There is an increasing threat of kidnap throughout South Africa. Kidnaps are generally for financial gain or motivated by criminality. In recent years several foreign nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals can be perceived as being wealthier than locals and may be at particular risk of kidnap for financial gain.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"airports\">Airports</h3>\n<p>There have been incidents involving people being followed from OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg to their destinations and then robbed, often at gunpoint. Be vigilant in and around the airport and when driving away.</p>\n\n<p>Thefts from baggage can occur at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. Consider vacuum-wrapping luggage where local regulations permit. Keep all valuables in your carry-on luggage.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h3>\n<p>The South African authorities publish indicative statistics on crime on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.statssa.gov.za\">Statistics South Africa website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"protests-and-demonstrations\">Protests and demonstrations</h2>\n<p>There are regular protest marches and strike related demonstrations, and periodic incidents of public disorder across South Africa, which can turn violent. Such protests, marches and demonstrations can occur anywhere in South Africa, sometimes at short notice. You should avoid areas where protests, demonstrations, or marches are taking place, especially in city centres and townships. Don\u2019t attempt to cross protester roadblocks as this could provoke a violent reaction. You should monitor local and social media for updates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in South Africa with a valid UK photocard driving licence for up to 12 months. If you have a paper licence, you should also get an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> before you travel. If you\u2019re living in South Africa, you should exchange your UK licence for a local licence within 12 months of your arrival. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-south-africa\">Living in South Africa guide</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n<p>Incidents of vehicle hijacking and robbery are common, particularly after dark. Keep to main roads and park in well-lit areas. Vulnerable areas include, but are not limited to: traffic lights, junctions, and when approaching or pulling out from driveways. Take care at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Thieves have been known to employ various methods to make a vehicle stop (e.g. placing large stones or glass in the road) in order to rob the occupants. Don\u2019t pick up strangers or stop to help apparently distressed motorists, as this is a technique sometimes used by hijackers. It is better to report any incident to the police. If you are involved in a hi-jacking, remain calm and surrender your valuables, and your vehicle if asked. Do not try to resist.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent incidents of car windows being broken and valuables taken while cars are waiting at junctions. Keep valuables out of sight.</p>\n\n<p>There are ongoing tensions between Uber and metered taxi drivers, which at times escalate into armed violence. Tensions have been particularly strong at taxi ranks outside some Gautrain stations and airports. Uber passengers have reported being on the receiving end of harassment from metered drivers. The Uber app generally reports where the trouble spots are, but you should exercise caution when using either service.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety</h3>\n<p>The standard of driving in South Africa varies and in 2018, there were more than 12,000 deaths as a result of road accidents. On highways, overtaking can occur in any lane including the hard shoulder. On single-lane roads the hard shoulder is also sometimes used by trucks and slower vehicles to allow faster vehicles to overtake. At some intersections, including 4-way stops and where traffic lights are out of service, the first vehicle to arrive generally has priority. On roundabouts, you should give way to the right, although this rule is often ignored.</p>\n\n<p>Road standards are mostly very good, but some roads in remote areas are less well maintained and may have potholes. Drive cautiously, obey speed limits and avoid unfamiliar rural areas at night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n<p>You\u2019re advised not to use the Metrorail suburban railway in the larger cities of South Africa and the long distance train services operated by the Passenger Rail Authority of South Africa (PRASA). Both are unreliable and have high crime levels including theft of infrastructure and criminal activity on board trains.</p>\n\n<p>The \u2018Gautrain\u2019 high speed commuter train service which runs between Johannesburg, Pretoria and the Oliver Tambo International Airport is secure and reliable. Buses and taxis are available at most Gautrain stations. Walking to and from Gautrain stations after dark isn\u2019t advisable.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-safety\">Water safety</h2>\n<p>Beach conditions and local safety provisions vary and every year significant numbers of people drown due to the strong sea currents. Most beaches do not have warning signs, flags or life-saving equipment. In the absence of warning signs, you can speak to local people who are familiar with the conditions. If in doubt, do not enter the water. On busier tourist beaches, follow instructions from lifeguards and any warnings that may be displayed. Watch this video to understand how to avoid being caught in a rip current, and contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nsri.org.za/\">National Sea Rescue Institute</a> in case of emergency.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Always carry a copy of your passport data page and the page containing your visitors permit or residence permit for South Africa.

Further information on medical tourism is available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/search?s=medical+tourism&amp;ge_srch=\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a>.

More information on the impact of travel and substance use is available on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.iamat.org/elibrary/view/id/1382\">International Association for Medical Assistance to Travellers</a></p>\n\n<p>Make sure to organise a contingency plan to cover what will happen if you relapse abroad, if the treatment plan is unsuccessful and/or you require unplanned repatriation to the UK (this plan may need to include additional availability of funds).</p>\n", "slug": "health", "title": "Health"}, {"body": "<p>There are limits on the amount of currency you can bring into South Africa.
