See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://mofamission.gov.iq/en/Kuwait\">Iraqi Embassy to Kuwait website</a> for more information</p>\n\n<p>Landmines and other hazardous ordnance are still present in Kuwait. You should avoid off-road driving. If you do travel off-road, restrict your movements to clearly identifiable tracks, and take great care even if an area has been officially cleared. Don\u2019t pick up any strange metal, plastic or other objects lying around.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you have a visit visa, you can drive in Kuwait using an <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> or a valid UK licence. From 28 March 2019, you should have the 1968 version IDP, as 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Kuwait after this date. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Before driving you must obtain third party insurance in Kuwait. If you\u2019re hiring a car, you can usually get insurance through your car hire company. If you\u2019re planning to drive a car belonging to a relative or friend then you\u2019re responsible for obtaining insurance. The insurance document must be kept with you at all times while driving.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re applying to live in Kuwait, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-kuwait\">Living in Kuwait guide</a> for information on driving licences.</p>\n\n<p>Driving is hazardous. Many drivers pay little attention to other road users; drive in excess of speed limits, switch lanes without warning, ignore traffic lights and use mobile phones while driving.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident you must stay with the vehicle. Call the police on 112 and don\u2019t attempt to move the vehicle before they arrive. If you have a major accident, where there are serious injuries or the car is not drivable, you must stay with the vehicle if it is safe to do so, call the police on 112, and do not attempt to move the vehicle before they arrive. If you have a minor accident, where there are no serious injuries and the car is drivable, try to take pictures of any damage to the vehicles involved in the accident if it is safe to do so. Record the licence plate numbers of any vehicles involved, and move the vehicle from the road to avoid blocking traffic (you can be fined if you fail to do so). Call the police and follow their instructions on what to do next.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Bubiyan and Warbah in the northern Gulf and Abu Musa, and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. The area in the northern Gulf, between Iran, Iraq and Kuwait has not been demarcated and vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected. There have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Following maritime restrictions issued by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior in 2011, you should take care when sailing in Kuwaiti waters. You should also remain alert to the effect any regional tensions may have on your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be under an increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by Dhow, as the safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Demonstrations and protests are uncommon in Kuwait and are normally, but not always, peaceful.
