Due to necessary repairs required to the Ascension Island runway, the Ministry of Defence has temporarily re-routed the flight (known as the South Atlantic Airbridge) via an alternative location.</p>\n\n<p>This service can be subject to delays due to poor weather, especially during the southern hemisphere winter. Total journey time is approximately 22 hours.

Coach, local bus and taxi services to and from Mount Pleasant Airport are available and can be booked in advance. Taxis are available in Stanley. Speed limits are 25mph in the Stanley area and 40mph on other roads.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the condition of most roads, and the strong winds, you should take great care when driving outside Stanley, especially on the road between Mount Pleasant Airport and Stanley. Deaths have occurred on this road and accidents are commonplace. Self-drive four-by-four vehicles are available for hire and a UK driving licence is sufficient. Laws on the wearing of seat belts and drink driving are strictly enforced.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mines\">Mines</h3>\n\n<p>Mines and unexploded ordnance from the 1982 conflict remains on the Falkland Islands and occasionally can be found on any of the major battle fields. All mine fields have been identified, are well mapped and fenced-off. The fences are hung with red warning triangles stating \u2018mines\u2019. It is an offence, punishable by imprisonment or large fine, to enter these areas, remove, damage or obscure the signs, or cut or remove any part of the fence.</p>\n\n<p>If you come across anything you think may be ordinance, please follow the below guidance from the Royal Falkland Islands Police:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Do NOT touch the item</li>\n  <li>Clearly mark the area where the item is</li>\n  <li>If safe to do so take a picture of the item but do not approach</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Call 999 from a safe distance and wait for the police to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Detailed maps of minefield locations are available locally.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"falkland-islands-government-london-office\">Falkland Islands Government London office</h3>\n\n<p>The Falkland Islands Government maintains an office in London that can provide further information for visitors:</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.falklands.gov.fk/self-governance/london-office/\">Falkland Islands Government Office</a></p>\n\n<p>Falkland House</p>\n\n<p>14 Broadway</p>\n\n<p>Westminster</p>\n\n<p>LONDON</p>\n\n<p>SW1H OBH</p>\n\n<p>Telephone:  020 7222 2542</p>\n\n<p>Fax:  020 7222 2375</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in the Falkland Islands, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.
