There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.</p>\n\n<p>If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.</p>\n\n<p>If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-facilities\">our list of healthcare providers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are tested and the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine until advised otherwise. You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. Costs related to transfer to alternative accommodation and treatment at state healthcare facilities will be covered by the Greek Government.The nature of your accommodation may differ from the specifications of your pre-booked hotel, villa or other place of stay.

Nationwide strikes and protests can occur at any time and may disrupt road/air/sea travel and cause delays/diversions at border crossings. You should follow local media reports and check with your travel operator. You should avoid large crowds and demonstrations. Some demonstrations in the past have turned violent.</p>\n\n<p>Road closures are common in Athens and are not always announced in advance. Demonstrations can be called at short notice, but there are certain dates on which demonstrations traditionally occur: 1 May, 17 November, and 6 December.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Most visits to Greece are trouble-free, but theft of passports, wallets and handbags are common on the metro and in crowded tourist places, particularly in central Athens. Leave valuables in a safe place at your hotel or apartment and carry a photocopy of your passport with you. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>When driving on holiday, keep your valuables out of sight and lock your vehicle at all times. Always park in a well-lit area or secure car park. Be alert to car crime.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are generally rare in Greece. Although there have been incidents involving British nationals in some holiday resorts frequented by large numbers of youth tourists. In some cases the alleged attackers were also British nationals. In many cases excessive drinking by either the victim or the offender preceded the incident. There have been some racially motivated attacks, mostly but not restricted to inner-city areas.</p>\n\n<p>Alcohol, drugs and use of nitrous oxide can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. We recommended only purchasing branded and labelled drinks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/going_abroad/index_en.htm\">European Commission</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/overseas/countrybycountry.html\">AA</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/countries/greece/\">RAC</a> guides on driving in Greece.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 696 road deaths in the Greece (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 6.5 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.7 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n<p>You can drive in Greece with a UK driving licence. Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Greece, check the <a href=\"/government/collections/overseas-living-in-guides\">Living in Guide</a> for information on requirements for residents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety</h3>\n<p>Make sure any vehicle you hire is in good condition and check that you\u2019re insured. When renting mopeds or quad bikes, insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance, which only covers the cost of damage to another vehicle. Any damage sustained to the rental vehicle in many cases may need to be paid for by you, or you may face arrest if you do not pay and the hire company decide to press charges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quad-biking\">Quad biking</h3>\n<p>Quad biking is considered an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. Specific travel insurance to cover quad bike rental is essential to avoid you having to pay the costs of private health care and/or repatriation to the UK. Always take care to read the details of your insurance cover before you travel on holiday, paying particular attention to the small print and exclusions on your insurance policy.</p>\n\n<p>If you do rent a quad bike, choose a category in accordance with your driving licence and age.  Drivers and passengers must wear helmets.  Failure to do so may invalidate your insurance and if stopped, you will be fined and your licence taken from you.\nIf you intend to hire a moped you will need a valid driving licence with at least category A1 - \u2018light motorcycle\u2019. Category P, which is valid in the UK for driving mopeds up to 50cc, is not valid in Greece.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sensitive-locations\">Sensitive locations</h2>\n<p>You shouldn\u2019t approach or take photos or videos of military installations, vehicles or buildings at any time. The Greek authorities will arrest and possibly prosecute anyone doing so. Certain border areas are also militarily sensitive. Although you can visit these areas, you should avoid taking photos or video footage.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-sports-and-swimming\">Water sports and swimming</h2>\n<p>Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.</p>\n\n<p>If you are considering taking part in water sports activities, do so through a licensed water sports centre and make sure paperwork is completed before starting the activity. Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://safewatersports.com/\">Safe Water Sports</a> website for more information.</p>\n\n<p>However inviting the blue waters may be, make sure you follow any warning signs, adhere to instructions from lifeguards and observe the flag indicators on beaches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>Since 1974, Greece has been a stable parliamentary democracy, with its head of state elected by the Parliament. It joined the European Union in 1981. Greece is going through a long-running economic crisis and its financial system is fragile. Greece has made positive steps in reducing its debts. Following the latest economic review, international creditors have released funds, but there remains a risk of further economic difficulties and related demonstrations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"migration\">Migration</h2>\n<p>Since 2015, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of migrants and refugees arriving on Greek islands, including Lesvos, Kos and Samos, and seeking to continue their journey via Greece to other EU countries. The flows have recently reduced significantly but the British Embassy is keeping the situation under review. At present there are no reports of any specific risks to British nationals visiting these islands or at border crossing points.</p>\n", "slug": "safety-and-security", "title": "Safety and security"}, {"body": "<p>Terrorist attacks in Greece can\u2019t be ruled out.

The police will make arrests and the courts are likely to impose heavy fines or prison sentences on people who behave indecently. Some fancy dress costumes may be regarded as offensive and therefore against decency laws.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs-and-alcohol\">Drugs and alcohol</h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t become involved with drugs of any kind, and don\u2019t bring drugs - including \u2018class C\u2019 drugs - from the UK. Possession of even small quantities can lead to a long prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Alcohol, drugs and use of nitrous oxide can make you less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment.</p>\n\n<p>The Greek authorities are clamping down on the sale of nitrous oxide as it is illegal to buy or sell for recreational use in Greece.

Failure to have such a certificate is punishable by a fine and or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Always insist on a contract for employment and check offered accommodation beforehand. Always keep your passport safe and do not hand over to others for safekeeping. If someone has taken your passport and is withholding it, report it to the police and/or contact the British Consulate for advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you feel you have been exploited during seasonal work, don\u2019t be afraid to seek advice.

These items are listed as weapons in Greece and fall under the current weapon possession law. You need to have a special licence from the local police authority to carry any weapon otherwise you might face arrest and legal charges. The same applies for knives; you need to have a special licence to carry any knife that is not made for domestic, professional, artistic or hunting use.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT travellers</h3>\n<p>Same-sex sexual relations are legal in Greece and civil unions between same-sex couples have been legal since 2015. The age of consent of 15 is the same as for partners of the opposite sex. Transgender people are able to change their legal gender. Anti-discrimination and hate speech laws apply to gender identity.</p>\n\n<p>Public attitudes towards homosexuality vary throughout the country; public displays of affection by same-sex couples may be frowned upon, especially in rural areas.</p>\n\n<p>Attitudes are generally much more welcoming in Athens and on many Greek islands, particularly on Lesvos, Mykonos and Skiathos, which are well known for their gay and lesbian scenes. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking\">Smoking</h3>\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to smoke in all indoor public places.
