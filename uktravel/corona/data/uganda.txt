Take care when travelling in the area. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo that border Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>On 2 April 2019 a foreign national and a Ugandan national were kidnapped from the Ishasha section of Queen Elizabeth National Park which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo. Both were released 7 April 2019.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel--eastern-uganda\">Local travel\u00a0- eastern Uganda</h3>\n<p>Travel to eastern Uganda is largely trouble free, but during heavy rains there is a risk of landslides particularly in Bulucheke sub-county in Bududa District near Mount Elgon National Park, a popular tourist destination.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel---national-parks\">Local travel - National Parks</h3>\n<p>Use reputable, registered tour operators and contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ugandawildlife.org/\">Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA)</a> for up to date advice and information before you travel. Mgahinga Gorilla National Park and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Parks are in the extreme south west of Uganda near the border with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-congo\">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/rwanda\">Rwanda</a>.

You should avoid taking these tours. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo that border Uganda, this includes Virunga National Park.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road Travel</h3>\n<p>You can drive in Uganda using a UK driving licence for up to 3 months, after which you will need to get a Ugandan driving licence from the Uganda Revenue Authority or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Travelling by road can be hazardous, particularly outside the main cities. Driving standards are poor, vehicles are often poorly maintained and the accident rate is high. Other road users may be driving without lights and livestock roam across the roads. The Jinja\u00a0- Kampala and the Kampala\u00a0- Masaka roads are particular accident black spots.</p>\n\n<p>Speed limits in built-up areas are generally 50km/h and out of town 80km/h. The police enforce this law and breaking speed limits can result in a fine, imprisonment or both.</p>\n\n<p>For reasons of road safety and security you should avoid travelling outside of the main towns after dark, except on the road between Kampala and Entebbe International Airport.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your vehicle is in good condition and stocked with items you might need in case of a breakdown or other incidents.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of serious accidents involving Ugandan long distance bus services, linking Kampala with other towns in Uganda and internationally with Nairobi, Kigali and Dar es Salaam. Some overnight buses have been robbed after being forced to stop by roadblocks or by criminals posing as passengers.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid using matatus (minibus taxis following a particular route) and boda-bodas (motorbike taxis). Though cheap, matatus and boda-bodas don\u2019t meet western safety standards, are generally in poor condition, badly driven and often don\u2019t have proper insurance cover. Accidents are common, and can be fatal. There have been recent incidents of foreign nationals being mugged whilst using boda-bodas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boattravel\">Boat\u00a0Travel</h3>\n<p>Large numbers of ferry passengers have died in accidents on Lakes Albert and Victoria in recent years. Police believe the accidents were caused by the overloading of passengers and goods.</p>\n\n<p>Use a reputable ferry company and if you believe a ferry to be overloaded or unseaworthy, don\u2019t get on. Familiarise yourself with emergency procedures on board and make a note of where the life jackets and emergency exits are located.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>There have been sporadic political protests throughout 2019 and 2020 and there remains an increased likelihood of protests across Uganda, particularly in the run up to the elections in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Political and other demonstrations can become violent without warning, causing loss of life and injury. The police have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition to disperse demonstrators. You should take great care and avoid all demonstrations and rallies where possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you find yourself caught up in a political demonstration, remain calm and try to move away from the area by the safest possible route. If you\u2019re travelling in a vehicle, ensure that the doors are locked. If you\u2019re in your accommodation and there\u2019s a demonstration nearby, remain inside if you judge that leaving your accommodation is threatening or unsafe. Familiarise yourself with the security procedures in place at your accommodation, and make sure appropriate precautions are deployed as necessary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"contacting-the-british-high-commission\">Contacting the British High Commission</h3>\n<p>You can keep up to date with travel advice by subscribing to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/email-signup\">email alerts</a>.
